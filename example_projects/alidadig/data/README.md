## Data files for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

My data folder is split into Raw_Data and Viewable_Data.
  
The Viewable_Data folder holds notebooks of the uploaded versions of the raw data in their table format and basic map plot so that I can reference these original format versions when I need to. 
  
My Viewable Data Folder contains:
   
   Diabetes.ipynb: Shows the reported Diabetes counts in last year in Philly zipcodes. As I am researching if access to healthy foods impacts the link between Diabetes and Income level, this dataset will be very important for me to map the areas of Philly with higher counts of Diabetes. 
   
   Income.ipynb: Contains median income of Philly zipcodes. As I am researching if access to healthy foods impacts the link between Diabetes and Income level, this dataset will be very important for me to map the areas of Philly with higher income. 
   
   Convenience Stores.ipynb: Locations of convenience stores such as Wawa or 7-11 in Philly with their name, address, and coordinates. These convenience stores will serve as my indication of access to unhleahty foods in Philly as convenience stores tend to sell more pre-packages junk food than farmers markets or healthy corner stores. 
   
   Farmers_Markets.ipynb: Locations of farmers markets in Philly with their name, address, coordinates, and other information like date/time they are open. 
   
   Healthy_Corner_Stores.ipynb: Locations of healthy corner stores in Philly with their name, address, and coordinates. 
          Taken together, the datasets for farmers markets and healthy corner stores locations will serve as my indication of access to healthy foods, compared to convenience store items. 
          
   Education.ipynb: Level of education by zipcode based on number of college, bachelors, masters degrees awarded with the zipcode. This will help me identify any correlation between education level and diabetes counts to see if education could be a variable in determining the relationship between income level and diabetes counts.
