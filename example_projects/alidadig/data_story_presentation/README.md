This folder contains the html and png files of all my output materials (graphs, maps, plots) that I want to show in my final presentation. 

My research question was:
Do varying levels of access to healthy and unhealthy foods influence the correlation between lower income and higher counts of diabetes? 

First, I show the correlation between lower income and higher counts of diabetes as a graph with Income_Diabetes_Correlational_Graph.png 

Then, I show an interactive map of all the farmers markets and healthy corner store combined so readers may observe and interact with the different locations in Philly with All_Healthy_Food_Locations_Interactive_Map.html. 

I also show an interactive map of all the convenience stores so reads can observe those and interact with the different stores such as wawa or 7-11 with Convenience Store Locations Interactive Map.html. 

Next, I show a dot map contrasting the healthy stores to convenience stores so viewers may see how dominant the convenience store locations are with All_Food_Locations_Dot_Map.png. 

Next, I use 2 bubble graphs to show the correlation between income, diabetes, and the number of unhealthy and then healthy locations in each zipcode with Income Diabetes Healthy Store Counts.html and Income Diabetes Unhealthy Store Counts.html. These maps shows that as income decreases and diabetes increases, the number of healthy and unhealthy stores also increases. This is not what I expected. 

So, I then show a bubble graph showing the correlation between income, diabetes, and the ratio of healthy to unhealthy stores in each zipcode with Income Diabetes Ratio of Store Counts.html. This map shows that as income decreases and diabetes increases, the ratio of healthy to unhealthy stores also increases. This is also not what I expected. 

I also use Ratio_and_Median_Income_Graph.png to show more clearly how the ratio of healthy to unhealthy increases significantly as income decreases. 

So if access to healthy stores AND the ratio of healthy to unhealthy stores are both not significant links to mediate the relationship between lower income and higher counts of diabetes, I then need to look at a different factor. Lastly, I show a bubble graph showing the correlation between education level, income, and diabetes counts with Income Diabetes Education Level.html. This graph shows that as income decreases and diabetes increases, education level decreases. I also use Income_Diabetes_Education_Graph.png to show more clearly the correlation between income and education level. 

My conclusion is that according to these datasets, access to healty food and the ratio of healthy to unhealthy food locations are not significant mediators between lower income and higher diabetes. Instead, education level is a strong link. More research can be down to find secondary mediations between lower education and higher counts of diabetes.
