## Data files for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

Multiple data files can be found in this data folder.

(1) The folder titled clean_data is my cleaned up data that I used for data analysis and manipulation. This includes reviews documents for the five primary Penn departments I looked at (COMM, ECON, HIST, PSCI, and PSYC), and one called df_new2 that is a concatenated dataframe with all five.

(2) The folder titled raw_data is the raw data, in dataframe form, pulled from the Penn Course Review API for each of the five above departments. 

(3) 2019A_wharton_reports_wharton-course-evaluations.csv is a CSV that I used for my initial data exploration, when I was waiting for the API token from Penn Labs to perform the bulk of my analysis. Although the Wharton data was not used in my ultimate data story, it was a key part of my data exploration and learning how to perform the kind of analyses I would need for my project.

(4, 5, 6) comm_revs.json, departments.json, and psci_revs.json are JSON files that I used to load the relevant data into my initial exploration notebooks. This was before I learned to use the parsing and normalizing functions in Python, which I ended up using. They are stored here for reference.
