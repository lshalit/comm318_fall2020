"This course deals with the relationship of economic principles to law and the use of economic analysis to study legal problems. Topics include property rights and intellectual property, analysis of antitrust, and economic analysis of legal decision making.

Students found the course to be a good introduction to law in economics. One student called it ""one of the better economics courses taken at Penn.” However, the material covered was straight from the textbook and the lectures were not comprehensive. One student said that attending lecture itself was not necessary as “I was better served reading the textbook on my own.” Others disagreed saying it was “an extremely valuable class.”

Professor Shachmurove received mixed reviews. Some say he spent too much time on non-course related topics and that that he could not ""explain concepts well.” However, many said the professor provided consistent emails informing students what they should read and study showing a “genuine concern for our own edification.”

Readings were thought to be too long but the course was highly recommended for Economics minors.

"The course is an introduction to the theory of international trade and international monetary economics. The theoretical background is used as a basis for discussion of policy issues. Studies include patterns of international trade and production; gains from trade; tariffs, and impediments to trade; foreign exchange markets, balance of payments, capital flows, financial crises, coordination of monetary and fiscal policy in a global economy.&#8232;&#8232;
One student reported it was a “very useful course in understanding international economics from the US point of view” and another wrote “Good course overall, no complaints.” However, several students said that one needed to be “very self-motivated” to be successful in class as there were very few assignments or quizzes to gage progress. Other said the requirements of answers on exams could be unclear.&#8232;&#8232;
Professor Ethier was described as “punctual, “efficient” and “endearing.” One student reported that Ethier was “an engaging, dynamic communicator of international economic movements.” Some students, however, said Ethier “does not explain concepts thoroughly” and because he wrote the textbook, concepts missed in class were also missed in readings because it was phrased in the same manner.&#8232;&#8232;
The course grades were based on exams, which were difficult to do well on. There were no weekly quizzes or homework to turn in and “hence the over-reliance on the midterms/exams.” The course requires prerequisites of ECON 001 and 002 or ECON 010. Students wishing to study the subject in greater depth should take instead the two-semester sequence ECON 251 and 252.

One student reported the course was “useful in terms of understanding exchange rates and international trading patterns, but focused a lot on actual problem solving and less on empirical values and conceptual ideas.” Another student echoed the same, “very good course covering a broad range of topics in international economics.” &#8232;
Professor Ozmucur exhibited “interest in what he’s teaching and doesn’t get annoyed if you ask him to explain things again” and he “was very enthusiastic about his class.” One student also wrote that Professor Ozmucur seems to “struggle to communicate the material effectively in lecture, but is great to work with one on one.” &#8232;

"Theories of consumer behavior, demand, production, costs, the firm in various market contexts, factor employment, factor incomes, elementary general equilibrium, and welfare.

&#8232;Most students were frustrated with the course and came out of it feeling as though they had a weak grasp on the material. Students felt that the book was useless as the professor barely utilized it. Students didn’t know what to expect from the class as there was no syllabus, no assigned readings and only three homework assignments. One student claimed that “the problems always seem very easy or very difficult, and there is no medium.”

&#8232;&#8232;While one student said that “Professor Zax is a nice man and…is very knowledgeable about what he teaches,” an overwhelming majority of students strongly disagreed. Many students said that Professor Zax was one of the worst professors they had ever had. Students complained that he tested them on material they had never gone over, was unresponsive when they went to him for help, took pleasure in students’ poor performances and had disorganized lectures with various mistakes.

&#8232;Economics 101 is a required course for the Economics major and is a prerequisite for all 200 level courses. It is strongly recommended that Econ 101 and 102 be taken immediately upon completion of Econ 1 and 2. Econ 101 is a prerequisite for Econ 102.

"Theories of consumer behavior, demand, production, costs, the firm in various market contexts, factor employment, factor incomes, elementary general equilibrium, and welfare.

Students had mixed reviews about the course. Some felt the course was highly informative and that they had a solid grasp of the fundamentals of microeconomics when the semester was over. They felt that the course was more or less straightforward. Others, however, felt that the material was covered “too fast in class, quizzes didn’t match what was done in class, and student interest wasn’t stimulated in any real way.” Another student yearned to learn more about the real applications to the current economy.

&#8232;Students felt that Professor Li genuinely cared about their feedback and tried to improve the course throughout the semester based on their comments. One student said, “Professor Li honestly cares for her students. She cares about what we think and tries her best to make sure that her students are learning.” Although some found that her teaching style could use some improvement, especially when explaining tricky mathematical problem sets, it is clear that these students were reassured by Professor Li’s desire to tailor her teaching to student needs. The multiple mid-semester evaluations that Professor Li gave out ensured that she would listen and improve the course while the students were still in it, not after the fact.

"This class focuses on the facts and theories about the determination of per capita income and its differences across countries and across time. It also looks at the study of economic fluctuations in output and employment and the role of government in influencing these aggregate variables: monetary and fiscal policy.

Generally speaking students enjoyed the class. They liked that the class was well structured and that the lectures and class notes were well organized. However, students felt that the reading was not helpful and that they barely used the book at all. Furthermore there were not a lot of practice problems to prepare for the exams.

&#8232;Professor Menzio was generally praised for his teaching ability. Students found him to be thorough, concise, knowledgeable, and very enthusiastic. Yet some students found that his explanations were sometimes hurried and hard to follow. They said that Professor Menzio would write something down and they would barely have time to write it down let alone absorb it before it was erased. Many felt that Professor Menzio didn’t prepare the class enough for exams. One student said that he, “got the impression that Professor Menzio did not like to take too much of his personal time to answer questions/post extra problems and he did not hold office hours after the review session to clear up some of the confusion and errors that had arose.”&#8232;

The biggest complaint was with the weighting of the exams; a student’s grade is based solely on three midterms or the final. Many students wished that the lowest exam grade would be dropped instead. Some students felt that the tests were “hard and required you to know the information very well” while others felt the exams were “straightforward and exactly like the homework assigned.” Prerequisites for the class are Economics 101, Mathematics 104 and either 114 or 115. Students who receive credit for Finance 101 or its equivalent will not receive credit for Economics 102. Economics 102 is a required course for the Economics major and is a prerequisite for all 200 level courses. It is strongly recommended that Econ 101 and 102 be taken immediately upon completion of Econ 1 and 2. Majors and prospective majors need to complete Math 104 prior to enrolling in Economics 101 or 102 and have completed or be concurrently enrolled in Math 114 (or 115).",15587-001-2921-GUIDO-MENZIO,GUIDO,2921-GUIDO-MENZIO,MENZIO,GUIDO MENZIO,/instructor/2921-GUIDO-MENZIO,58,59,/courses/15587/sections/1/reviews/2921-GUIDO-MENZIO,2.37,2.58,2.14,2.91,2.60,2.79,1.27,3.42,1.34,2.42,,2.00,['ECON-102-001'],15587-001,INTERMED MACROECONOMICS,/courses/15587/sections/1,ECON-102-001,001,2009A
"This class focuses on the facts and theories about the determination of per capita income and its differences across countries and across time. It also looks at the study of economic fluctuations in output and employment and the role of government in influencing these aggregate variables: monetary and fiscal policy.

Generally speaking students enjoyed the class. They liked that the class was well structured and that the lectures and class notes were well organized. However, students felt that the reading was not helpful and that they barely used the book at all. Furthermore there were not a lot of practice problems to prepare for the exams.

&#8232;Professor Menzio was generally praised for his teaching ability. Students found him to be thorough, concise, knowledgeable, and very enthusiastic. Yet some students found that his explanations were sometimes hurried and hard to follow. They said that Professor Menzio would write something down and they would barely have time to write it down let alone absorb it before it was erased. Many felt that Professor Menzio didn’t prepare the class enough for exams. One student said that he, “got the impression that Professor Menzio did not like to take too much of his personal time to answer questions/post extra problems and he did not hold office hours after the review session to clear up some of the confusion and errors that had arose.”&#8232;

The biggest complaint was with the weighting of the exams; a student’s grade is based solely on three midterms or the final. Many students wished that the lowest exam grade would be dropped instead. Some students felt that the tests were “hard and required you to know the information very well” while others felt the exams were “straightforward and exactly like the homework assigned.” Prerequisites for the class are Economics 101, Mathematics 104 and either 114 or 115. Students who receive credit for Finance 101 or its equivalent will not receive credit for Economics 102. Economics 102 is a required course for the Economics major and is a prerequisite for all 200 level courses.

"This course is designed to introduce students to econometric techniques and their applications in economic analysis and decision making. The course covers linear regression models, simultaneous-equations models, discrete choice models and univariate time series models. Estimation and Inference is conducted using least squares and likelihood based techniques. The main objective of the course is to train the student in (i) handling economic data; (ii) quantitative analysis of economic models with probabilistic tools; (iii) econometric techniques, their application as well as their statistical and practical interpretation; (iv) implementing these techniques on a computer.

The course was considered very informative and useful. Some students felt that the lectures were ""boring"" and ""dry,” but still very important. However, the pacing was considered a little off as all the complex material was crammed into the end. Some students felt that the problem sets were too difficult to do using lecture materials.

Professor Krasnokutskaya was thought to be unapproachable by some students but others thought that she was the ""best econometrics professor"" and was very straightforward and clear.

There were 5 problem sets, a project and 3 in-class tests, which according to many students were good as it made them stay on top of their work. Students also liked that there was a real world application of the material.

"This course is designed as a sequel to Econ 6 (Introduction to Econometrics) and focuses on forecasting. Forecasting is important, as forecasts are constantly made in business, economics, government, &#64257;nance, and many other &#64257;elds and much depends on them. This course introduces students to econometric time-series models and methods that can be used to generate forecasts. EVIEWS is used for computer-based calculations. &#8232;&#8232;

Students praised this course, describing it as \""amazing\"" and \""interesting,\"" with some calling it one of their favorite classes taken at Penn.

"This course will use basic microeconomic tools to understand how the law can promote economic efficiency. The class will discuss tort law, property law, intellectual property, and antitrust regulation with a distinction made between common law and legislative law.
Students felt that the “current and relevant” material made this an enlightening course. However, they found it “poorly planned,” focusing more on game theory than on law and economics; topics were “scattered” and sometimes even “completely unrelated” to law and economics. There were several guest lectures, which some found informative and “a nice change of pace,” but others commented that they wasted time, leaving students to learn the material on their own from an “intensely detailed and difficult text.” Assignments included multiple projects, quizzes, and midterms.
Students were split in opinion of Professor Shachmurove. A few students thought Dr. Shachmurove was “excellent at communicating subject matter,” “extremely capable,” and a man who “truly cares about his students.” He made the course “fun and interesting” and conveniently “always posted slides of his lectures online.” However, students also reported that he put too much text on each slide, making presentations “difficult to follow.” Additionally, he was occasionally “impatient and critical” of students’ questions. &#8232;&#8232;Students summed up the course as “difficult, but rewarding.” Students explained, “We had to learn everything on our own,” by studying for tests “often,” but only a “little at a time.” Despite mixed reviews, many students enjoyed the subject matter, calling it an “excellent component to my econ major” and “one of the most useful courses I have taken at Penn.”",15595-001-339-YOCHANAN-SHACHMUROVE,YOCHANAN,339-YOCHANAN-SHACHMUROVE,SHACHMUROVE,YOCHANAN SHACHMUROVE,/instructor/339-YOCHANAN-SHACHMUROVE,54,60,/courses/15595/sections/1/reviews/339-YOCHANAN-SHACHMUROVE,2.83,2.09,2.33,2.46,2.85,2.27,2.85,2.87,1.57,2.00,,2.72,['ECON-234-001'],15595-001,LAW AND ECONOMICS,/courses/15595/sections/1,ECON-234-001,001,2009A
"This course covers topics in macroeconomics. It studies how household decision-making and government politics and interventions determine macroeconomic aggregates. There will be an emphasis on developing and applying economic models. &#8232;Course content was based on popular macroeconomic models and related papers in order to teach students how to use numerical methods to solve macroeconomic problems.
Students commented that concepts, models, and papers presented in class are “fascinating.” They “learned a lot” in this “great course.” However, the course’s emphasis on Matlab (a programming language that is not taught in the class) made assignments “tough” for those who were unfamiliar with it, because programming comprised much of the exams. Those who did have experience programming found the use of Matlab in an economic context “interesting” and “valuable,” citing assignments as “difficult,” but “rewarding.”&#8232;&#8232;
Students described Professor Greenwood as “a genius” and “an excellent professor.” He made the content “incredibly interesting” and was “very open to discussing the material both inside and outside of the classroom.” Some felt that he did not present enough specific examples of the material, but rather explained it all in theory. Students were troubled by his refusal to answer questions during the exam period, as well as his failure to return exams or distribute solutions, which made it difficult to learn from past errors and improve.
This course is recommended to students considering graduate studies in economics, as evidenced from the prerequisites. This course is difficult and “not for the faint of heart.” Exams took many students “over 20 hours each.” The amount of work required and previous knowledge of Matlab were described as “too much,” leading students to claim it “should be a 300-level class or honor’s thesis” rather than 200-level. Matlab programming language created a “considerable obstacle for students with no background in computer programming.” This led to a skewed grade distribution, with a “disparity between grades of those who can program and those who can’t.”",15596-001-4300-JEREMY-GREENWOOD,JEREMY,4300-JEREMY-GREENWOOD,GREENWOOD,JEREMY GREENWOOD,/instructor/4300-JEREMY-GREENWOOD,29,31,/courses/15596/sections/1/reviews/4300-JEREMY-GREENWOOD,2.48,2.27,2.25,3.58,2.16,2.43,2.13,2.62,0.69,2.19,,3.19,['ECON-242-001'],15596-001,NUM.

"This course is concerned with how individuals make decisions in a world full of uncertainties, both normatively and descriptively. It is also designed to help build skills in understanding and analyzing a choice problem with uncertainty in a systematic fashion, as well as deepening the student’s understanding of the fundamental concept of a utility function, which plays a critical role in economic modeling. The course requires a substantial ability of abstract thinking. Homework is intended to be thought-provoking rather than skill-sharpening. Topics covered in the course usually include balance-of-payments adjustment, theories of exchange rate determination, the effects of exchange rate devaluation, macroeconomic policy under fixed and floating exchange rates, the Euro-dollar market, currency and balance of payments crises.

Students tended to find the concepts covered in this course “interesting,” but a few felt that there was a lack of cohesiveness in the course and experienced some confusion regarding how “the stuff from the beginning of [the] semester works with the stuff from the end.”

Multiple students agreed that Professor Ethier had a “great sense of humor.” Many also wrote that he was “very bright” and “certainly knows what he’s talking about.” Some students, including those who found Professor Ethier to be quite knowledgeable, wrote that he went “over concepts very quickly.” Many found it necessary to read the textbook closely before class in order to keep up with the concepts covered in lecture.

This course did not require extensive work outside of class except for textbook readings. Some students complained that the quick pace of the class made it difficult to keep up and prepare for the final exam. One student wrote, “the tests are too easy” and others believed that the topics are not tested evenly.

In particular, the course will analyze determinants of demand for medical care, such as health status, insurance coverage, and income; the unique role of physicians in guiding and shaping the allocation of resources in medical care markets; and competition in medical care markets, especially among hospitals.

Students agreed that the “material is incredibly diverse and interesting.” However, some students wrote that they “would have rather learned less material and gone more in depth.” Also, some found the textbook unhelpful. Despite these concerns, many students wrote that this is “one of the best” classes at Penn.

Many students complimented Professor David as an “excellent professor,” “a great lecturer,” and “knowledgeable.” Students also found his slides “helpful” as they were “clear and concise.” In fact, students would have preferred not having guest lectures.

One student expressed concern that what was covered in class had little to do with problem sets and exams. Another student recommends this class primarily to those interested in “medicine or health care management.” Nevertheless, most students recommend the class to others and feel that it is easy to do well “if you at least put in the effort.”",15862-401-2995-GUY-DAVID,GUY,2995-GUY-DAVID,DAVID,GUY DAVID,/instructor/2995-GUY-DAVID,118,122,/courses/15862/sections/401/reviews/2995-GUY-DAVID,2.73,3.08,2.84,2.38,2.75,3.13,1.76,3.56,2.28,2.92,,1.87,"['HCMG-302-401', 'ECON-236-401']",15862-401,ECON & FIN HLTH CARE DEL,/courses/15862/sections/401,HCMG-302-401,401,2009A

Students gave mixed reviews for this course, but in general found it to be “okay but not very stimulating.” Some wished more of a focus could be given on theory and concepts, and less on quantitative aspects. Several students complained that the lectures did not match very well with the required readings in the book but recommended reading them anyway to help with exams.

Several students liked Professor Spiegel’s “eccentricity” and said that he was “very helpful one-on-one and during office hours”. Students strongly recommended that any student who takes Professor Spiegel’s class sit near the front because not only he is soft-spoken but also the figures he draws on the board are often small. Some students expressed difficulty understanding his accent but “got used to it” as the class went on. Students also wished Professor Spiegel could be more structured in his lectures, for he sometimes “referenced stuff we haven’t even covered yet, and those references turn into full on discussions.” Others commented that Professor Spiegel seemed to assume that students already understood basic Economics.

"This course is divided into halves, each taught by a different professor. The first part of the course covers basic microeconomic concepts such as opportunity cost, comparative advantage, supply and demand, importance of costs and revenues under perfect competition vs. monopoly, externalities and public goods. This course review will focus on the first half of Econ 010, taught by Professor Stein. The second part of the course introduces macroeconomic data, two models of the labor market, a model of the aggregate household, and the standard AD-AS model. The course concludes with an introduction to fiscal policy, banking, and the role of the Central Bank.

Reviews for the microeconomics sector of Econ 010 were overwhelmingly positive. Students felt that the course offered “a firm foundation in economics” and were happy with the information that they learned. Further students described lectures as “fulfilling and effective”.

Students also awarded much praise to Professor Stein, insisting that “Dr. Stein really was able to stimulate the students' interest in economics”. Overall, students agreed that Prof. Stein’s easily understood teaching approach was well designed for an introductory course.

"Economics 2, the follow up to the prerequisite course Economics 1, focuses on macroeconomics and understanding the relationship between a market economy and national output. Emphasis is placed on the study of monetary and fiscal policy, including analysis of government policies, short-run economic stability, the degree of unemployment, and the rate of inflation. Other major topics discussed in the course are international trade, economic development, and comparative economic systems. The main text for the course is Parkin “Macroeconomics”, 9th edition.

Most students found this course interesting and especially liked how Professor Jao connected the material to current events. According to one student, the “contemporary examples we studied were the most interesting aspects of the course,” and Professor Jao “did a fabulous job of helping to make the course relevant to the real world and current events.” However, other students were displeased with the current event focus. One student said that the course did not “seem to be an introduction to macroeconomics,” but rather a “current event class.” Moreover, many students felt one of the course’s assignments — a “Great Economic Debate,” — “took away valuable class time” and was not helpful for understanding the course material.

Although many students described Professor Jao as “excited,” “passionate,” and “enthusiastic,” there was a diverse opinion on the quality of instruction. Some students found that Professor Jao was able to communicate concepts well, but many commented the instruction was “dry” and confusing. Many students felt frustrated with Professor Jao’s teaching style and the organization of the course, commenting that this class was one of the worst they have experienced at Penn. However, many students commented that they understood Professor Jao was a first year Economics 2 instructor and believe that the quality of instruction will improve. Some students stated that Professor Jao was kind, friendly, and very accessible, but students generally agreed that Professor Jao was “not very responsive or accepting to the feedback both from TAs and from the students.”

The greatest criticism of Professor Jao was that her exams and quizzes were unfair and inconsistent. The majority of students felt they were tested on their ability to “regurgitate” facts from PowerPoint slides rather than on economic concepts. Students commented that when it came to exams, “we never knew what to expect or what to focus on.” Many students found the readings assigned were interesting, but overwhelming. Additionally, students found online work unhelpful for scoring well on exams and quizzes. Many students found the course difficult, stressful, and would not recommend it to non-majors.

"Intermediate Economics is an upper level economics course, which focuses on theories of consumer behavior, demand, production, costs, the firm in various market contexts, factor employment, factor incomes, elementary general equilibrium, and welfare.

Many students commented that they loved this course and learned a lot, specifying that it was “interesting and relevant.” A few students expressed disappointment that the course was not more extensive for an intermediate level course and found the assignments unrelated to the course content.

Overall, students seemed to agree Professor Okada was able to communicate the course material well. One student even commented that they would “recommend Dr. Okada for anyone.” However, many students also found Professor Okada unapproachable and unwilling to discuss problems in class. A number of students also felt Professor Okada was frequently unprepared, that the course moved slowly, and that overall the class was disorganized. Students were frustrated that at the end of the course they had no “long run” understanding of the material, but only the knowledge of how to solve particular problems.

Most students enrolled in this course intend on becoming economics majors or minors. Students felt Professor Okada’s policy for “quizzes rather than midterms and finals works out much better,” but still thought grading was “slightly unfair” and wished the lowest quiz grade could be dropped. One student commented “attending class all semester and struggling every week until I had completed all assigned homework problems” was not enough to receive a good grade. This course is a requirement for economics majors and minors and is not recommended for non-majors.

"ECON 252 International Finance focuses on international monetary economics with emphasis on economic policy in an open economy. Topics covered in the course include: balance-of-payments adjustment, theories of exchange rate determination, the effects of exchange rate devaluation, macroeconomic policy under fixed and floating exchange rates, the Euro-dollar market, currency and balance of payments crises.

Students agreed that the course was “very informative and interesting.” One student even commented that this course was “one of the better classes I have taken in the economics department.”

Students praised Professor Azzimonti, commenting that she was “excellent”, “enthusiastic”, and “interesting.” Students also appreciated that Professor Azzimonti was extremely accessible and wanted her students to master the material. A minor frustration students expressed was difficulty in reading Professor Azzimonti’s handwriting and would have preferred “more structured notes.”

Across the board, students found the course “tough” and “difficult.” Students agreed the problem sets were “challenging” but were also “fair” and “valuable.” Students also agree the exams were “very, very, very hard.” Overall, one student commented that while they’re “not expecting an A by any stretch of the imagination, I feel as if I mastered elements of economic theory and practice that I can translate into understanding real-world events.”

"This course is about strategically interdependent decisions. It will introduce and develop some basic ideas from game theory, using illustrations, applications, and cases drawn from business, economics, politics, sports, and even fiction and movies. Some interactive games will be played in class. There will be little formal theory, and the only prerequisites are some high-school algebra and ECON 001. However, general numeracy (facility interpreting and doing numerical graphs, tables, and arithmetic calculations) is very important. This course can be counted toward the Economics minor or as an Econ elective.

Many students found that this course “has the potential to be interesting” because of the subject matter on “strategic reasoning skills applicable to life”. However, students reported that “this was not an easy class” and warned that both the course material and the difficulty of exams made PPE 201 challenging for those with only a light understanding of Economics. The math required was reported to be “extremely heavy”. Students hope that the material will be covered “at a more meticulous pace” if the course is to remain a requirement for PPE majors.

While many students found Professor Dillenberger to be “enthusiastic about the subject material,” and “well-intentioned” others reported that he was often difficult to hear and understand. Questions could be addressed in office hours, where students said he was “very approachable”. Office hours are the students’ main source for assistance, as the course does not include recitations.

Grading in this class was reported to be “extremely harsh”. Additionally, the difficulty level for the final exam was reported to be “exponentially more difficult than anything else in the class, and Professor Dillenberger failed to prepare the students to be in a position where they could do well”. The final was, however, curved to provide students with more acceptable grades. There were many complaints about coordination between the grader of the course and the professor for students felt that there was a “lack of communication”. Some students complained that the system of re-grading is not generous for the four problem sets that are required throughout the course of the semester. Although the class is required for the PPE major, students warn that “the course overall will significantly hurt our GPAs”.",17938-401-4533-DAVID-DILLENBERGER,DAVID,4533-DAVID-DILLENBERGER,DILLENBERGER,DAVID DILLENBERGER,/instructor/4533-DAVID-DILLENBERGER,103,122,/courses/17938/sections/401/reviews/4533-DAVID-DILLENBERGER,2.51,1.75,1.93,3.22,2.43,2.03,2.28,2.77,1.43,1.91,,2.90,"['PPE-201-401', 'ECON-013-401']",17938-401,STRATEGIC REASONING,/courses/17938/sections/401,PPE-201-401,401,2009C

"Econ001-microeconomics-is the introductory course of the Economics program at Penn. Microeconomics encompasses the economic decisions of individual people and firms, the determination of prices and quantities of individual goods, wages for various classes of workers, and the theoretical basis for international trade. Taxes, subsidies, tariffs, trade quotas, and income redistribution are also covered during the semester. The course draws heavily from the contemporary United States economy for examples of these economic theories. Grades are based on objective exam scores, online homework assignments (called APLIA), and quizzes. 

Most students felt that they learned a lot from the course. However, some felt that the class didn\'t have the appropriate amount of time to go over some of the material. “I felt like a ton of material was squeezed into just a few classes,” one student said. “We never really got to learn it.”

The majority of students agreed that the course was “well-taught” and that Stein was “amazing,” alluding to her use of technology as a major plus in the course. However, some students did complain about her time management. As was stated above, many had problems with the amount of material covered in a few of the classes.

The exams were a major source of strife for students, who said that although the class required a lot of work, most of it did not prepare students for the “numerical” types of problems on tests. Test questions were also described as “tricky” and “extremely difficult” relative to practice problems used in homework and quizzes. Students complained that the course\'s homework problems (APLIA), textbook material, lectures, and tests did not correspond with each other at all, leading to major frustration and confusion about exams.

"This course is an introduction to economic analysis and its application.  It examines the market economy to provide an understanding of how the size and composition of national output are determined.  Topics covered include: elements of monetary and fiscal policy, international trade, economic development, and comparative economic systems.

Students commented that the course gave them a good understanding of macro-theory and the current economy.  The information covered in lecture, powerpoint slides, and textbook readings was all the same, and some described the lectures as “boring.” Students all agreed that they learned a lot in the course, though many thought the material was not cohesive and it was difficult to link the topics together.

There was a large discrepancy in the comments about the quality of Professor Eudey’s teaching.  Some praised her as “knowledgeable” and a “good communicator,” who was available for further explanation during office hours. Many more students, however, agreed that she sped through the material too quickly and was “wordy” or unclear in her explanations. Many said that Professor Eudey’s explanations of course material were “difficult to understand.” These students commented that future students enrolled in the class would benefit from a textbook not written by the professor.

A thorough understanding of the concepts presented in ECON001 is necessary for this course.  However, unlike ECON001, there was little math involved and the emphasis was on “sound economic principles.”  Many students commented that Professor Eudey did not explain theories on a beginner’s level, requiring that students remember micro-material.  Students also complained that the homework questions were vague and not representative of the kind of information and concepts needed for the exams.  Exams were described as “difficult” and “confusing.”  Some students recommending taking this class pass/fail, if it is not required for a major or minor. Students generally found the course material “interesting” but sometimes “overwhelming” and “complicated.” Almost all students complained that the textbook, written by Professor Eudey, was not only “ambiguous” and “very difficult to understand”, but also “useless.”",20015-001-321-WENDY-EUDEY,WENDY,321-WENDY-EUDEY,EUDEY,WENDY EUDEY,/instructor/321-WENDY-EUDEY,137,215,/courses/20015/sections/1/reviews/321-WENDY-EUDEY,2.97,2.90,2.69,2.47,2.84,2.88,2.47,3.60,2.66,2.41,,2.25,['ECON-002-001'],20015-001,INTRO ECON MACRO,/courses/20015/sections/1,ECON-002-001,001,2008A

"Public Finance is separated into two parts. The first looks at market and government failures, the need for sound public policies, the limits of policy effectiveness, and the evaluation of public projects using cost benefit analysis. The second part focuses on the economic analysis of taxation, including the economics incidence and efficiency of taxes. 
	
Students loved the way that the course material was applied to real world situations calling it “interesting and thought provoking. What a real college class should be.” Several students mentioned that it was unlike any other economics course they had taken: “It was the first time I had to write a paper for an Economics class,” said one student. Another mentioned, “I found the course very informative and less abstract than many other Econ classes.” Despite the unique way the material was presented, some students claimed that there was virtually no new material covered that wasn’t learned in Econ101 and 102, saying that “at times it felt like a repeat of previous classes.” 
	
Students loved Professor Eekhout. Many mentioned that they “enjoyed the professor’s anecdotes and connections to the real world.”  Students commented that they “were never bored in class,” and that “it was so refreshing to have a professor who is so passionate and stimulating.”

"This course covers the relationship of economic principles to law and the use of economic analysis to study legal problems. Topics included: property rights and intellectual property; analysis of antitrust and economic analysis of legal decision making.

Students in general felt that the class covered “too much game theory and not enough legal theory.” Many students complained of a lack of structure in the course, and often felt unsure of what was covered on exams. Students felt that the course suffered from “switching between a variety of readings” that, while “helpful and engaging”, often resulted in a haphazard covering of the material. Most students enjoyed the guest speakers brought in, and some did feel that it was a “great academic/intellectual course.”

Most students felt that Professor Scachmurove was “passionate and engaged”, “tried very hard to connect with his students” and was “very willing to help”. However, many said that he was “difficult to understand” and was “unable to communicate with students”. Overall, most students agreed that Professor Scachmurove had “good intentions”, but his teaching style needed work, in the words of one student, “speak loudly and have enthusiasm, you have great things to say.”

Students felt that this course would really only be suitable for an economics major.",20026-001-339-YOCHANAN-SHACHMUROVE,YOCHANAN,339-YOCHANAN-SHACHMUROVE,SHACHMUROVE,YOCHANAN SHACHMUROVE,/instructor/339-YOCHANAN-SHACHMUROVE,56,96,/courses/20026/sections/1/reviews/339-YOCHANAN-SHACHMUROVE,2.13,1.55,1.82,2.66,2.82,1.77,2.20,2.21,1.07,1.61,,2.48,['ECON-234-001'],20026-001,LAW AND ECONOMICS,/courses/20026/sections/1,ECON-234-001,001,2008A

The course explores patterns of international trade and production; gains from trade; tariffs, and other impediments to trade; foreign exchange markets, balance of payments, capital flows, financial crises, coordination of monetary and fiscal policy in a global economy.&#8232;&#8232;Students found the course interesting, but many feel that it wasn’t so much the topic as the professor that made the course enjoyable.&#8232;&#8232;Students raved about Professor Weiss. He was described as “awesome”, “engaging” and “the best at articulating and explaining difficult material”. He told real stories from his own experience to show how the course concepts are applied in the real world. &#8232;&#8232;Prerequisites are Economics 1 and 2.

"Intermediate Microeconomics covers theories of consumer behavior, demand, production, costs, the firm in various market contexts, factor employment, factor incomes, elementary general equilibrium, and welfare.&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;All students seemed to describe the course material as “challenging” or “difficult,” but while many “thoroughly enjoyed” the course and “valued” the material, many others found it too difficult and demanding to understand or learn from. The lectures dealt almost entirely with the conceptual and theoretical, and students practiced numerical examples and problem solving on their weekly problem sets. Students felt that this particular course covered more material than other Econ 101 classes.&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;While students found Professor Mailath to be very “knowledgeable” and a “gifted” economist, many found his teaching style inappropriate for the undergraduate level. Overall, students thought Professor Mailath moved too quickly during lecture and found his purely theoretical teaching style difficult to translate to problem sets and exam questions. Students consistently found him unwilling to grant their requests to provide any numerical examples during lecture, but a few students reported that he was very helpful during office hours. Professor Malaith also provided annotated lecture slides online that one student reported finding very useful. A significant number of students commented that they felt too intimidated to ask questions in class. Professor Malaith does not follow the textbook and tended to skip from one chapter to another.&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;Prerequisites for this course are ECON 001 and 002, MATH 104 and either MATH 114 or MATH 115. Students found this course extremely challenging. This course is required for economics majors, and most students who took this class did so to fulfill their major requirement. Students were assigned “long,” “complex,” and “very difficult” weekly problem sets, which they reported took about ten hours to complete. Exams were also described as “challenging” and “difficult,” with the class average usually around 50%. However, one student noted that Professor Mailath was generous with the curve. Even the more seasoned economics students who commented that they enjoyed the class described it as “very hard.",21552-001-1362-GEORGE-J-MAILATH,GEORGE J,1362-GEORGE-J-MAILATH,MAILATH,GEORGE J MAILATH,/instructor/1362-GEORGE-J-MAILATH,103,116,/courses/21552/sections/1/reviews/1362-GEORGE-J-MAILATH,2.40,2.10,2.03,3.61,2.05,2.17,1.44,3.18,1.08,1.92,,3.35,['ECON-101-001'],21552-001,INTERMED MICROECONOMICS,/courses/21552/sections/1,ECON-101-001,001,2011A

"This course focuses on elementary probability and inferential statistical techniques. The course begins with a survey of basic descriptive statistics and data sources and then covers elementary probability theory, sampling, estimation, hypothesis testing, correlation, and regression. The course focuses on practical issues involved in the substantive interpretation of economic data using the techniques of statistical inference. For this reason empirical case studies that apply the techniques to real-life data are stressed and discussed throughout the course, and students are required to perform several statistical analyses of their own. Students need to complete MATH 104 and MATH 114 or 115 as prerequisites. &#8232;&#8232;While some students said that the class was boring and confusing, others said that it was straightforward and easy to follow. The course gives a solid foundation in statistics for those who are interested in economics. In general students found that they gained valuable tools from taking the course. &#8232;&#8232;Professor De Paula was described as nice and good at explaining the material. He was also said to be quite accessible outside of class to answer questions. He was praised for reaching out to his students, his good nature and for maintaining a clear organization of the class. &#8232;&#8232;The course moves a bit fast and although the professor is great at explaining new concepts, students found that the material sometimes does not coincide with tests.

"Introduction to economic analysis and its application. Topics include: theory of supply and demand, costs and revenues of the firm under perfect competition, monopoly and oligopoly, pricing of factors of production, income distribution, and theory of international trade. Econ 1 deals primarily with microeconomics.

Students generally enjoyed the course. Some felt it was ""a great class"" while one said, ""The course content was fabulous."" Other students generally commented that it was a ""good introductory class"" and the ""material was interesting.""

A lot of students generally liked Professor Spiegel. Some students said that he was ""an excellent instructor"" but some complained that ""his accent can make his lecturing almost incomprehensible beyond the first few rows."" One student said, ""Dr. Spiegel does a great job of making himself available to students. Outside of his regular office hours, he is open to students coming to talk to him if his office hours conflict with the students' schedules.""

The class has a lot of freshmen, but upperclassmen do take the class as well. There are a few quizzes that are reportedly not difficult.

"Introduction to economic analysis and its application. Topics include: theory of supply and demand, costs and revenues of the firm under perfect competition, monopoly and oligopoly, pricing of factors of production, income distribution, and theory of international trade. Econ 1 deals primarily with microeconomics.

Students generally enjoyed the course. Some felt it was ""a great class"" while one said, ""The course content was fabulous."" Other students generally commented that it was a ""good introductory class"" and the ""material was interesting.""

A lot of students generally liked Professor Spiegel. Some students said that he was ""an excellent instructor"" but some complained that ""his accent can make his lecturing almost incomprehensible beyond the first few rows."" One student said, ""Dr. Spiegel does a great job of making himself available to students. Outside of his regular office hours, he is open to students coming to talk to him if his office hours conflict with the students' schedules.""

The class has a lot of freshmen, but upperclassmen do take the class as well. There are a few quizzes that are reportedly not difficult. There are also exams that are fairly difficult, but the grading curve is said to be very generous. Students recommend this class to both majors and non-majors. There are no prerequisites for the class, and it fulfills the Society requirement.

The course covers the theory of supply and demand, costs and revenues of the firm under perfect competition, monopoly and oligopoly, pricing of factors of production, income distribution, and theory of international trade. 

Most students described this course as a good and “effective” introduction to economics. Something several students appreciated was that the class “is well linked to reality and application” and was relevant to the real world. The students were mixed on whether or not the amount of math involved was heavier or lighter than they had expected it to be. One student also remarked that at times it could be “dry” and another complained that the textbook was “completely useless.” However, overall students reported enjoying the class. 

Students almost unanimously praised Professor Stein. She was described as “passionate” and given credit for being able to stimulate interest. Though most of her students remarked how “fun” and “engaging” she was, one student did say that at times she “came off a little bored or uninterested.” Her lectures were apparently well done and “easy to follow” and many students give her credit for the success of the course. The class was too large for close interaction between individual students and the teacher; however, many students acknowledged that Professor Stein was very responsive to students trying to contact her and was willing to discuss any issue. 

The course was described as being “very well done,” though some students did find the material a little difficult. The biggest complaint was the “badly worded” and complex exams that were also graded very harshly. The class is appropriate for anyone to take and Professor Stein “caters to freshman.” Additionally it fulfills the Society Sector requirement and is needed in order to take most classes in the ECON department.

Professor Bossi received mixed reviews from the students. Some students were confused by his teaching style and found him to be a poor lecturer, just reading off the slides. A couple of students remarked that he seemed “inexperienced.” However, the majority of the students appreciated his sense of humor, calling him “hilarious” and an “entertaining” lecturer.

Students reported that this course “addressed important questions” and made them “think critically.” Some students regretted that although it was a small class, “there was little to no discussion.” Others were disappointed by a lack of depth, as only one textbook was used and no outside readings were incorporated. Additionally, since the course covers “approximately 15 chapters in one semester,” it was difficult to cover any individual topic in much depth. Several students also expressed a desire for the course to be more structured.

He “doesn’t believe in talking about grades or how you’re going to be graded,” and he “does not respond promptly or at all” to student emails. Many students also found him to be disorganized. One student noted that the “instructor is brilliant” but may not realize “that the class isn’t following along.” A few students commented that the professor follows the book very closely, even using PowerPoint slides from the book. 

This upper-level economics class was recommended to economics majors. One student recommended this course to “anyone seeking to work in International Development…because it demonstrates the difficulty there is in achieving development.” Some students mentioned that assignments did not have much use because they were not returned to students and did not seem to reinforce concepts. Others expressed confusion over the system of grading used on exams.

Many complained that “homework and quizzes were not representative of the material taught in class,” which made it “difficult to study for the exams, and several students claimed that the course would benefit from “a more structured plan.”

Opinions about Professor Liu were quite mixed. Many cited his strong accent as a real hindrance to their understanding during the first few weeks of the course. Some felt that this “was not so much a problem as the course progressed,” and found Professor Liu “brilliant” and “clearly passionate about the material.” One student wrote that Professor Liu was “extremely talented at explaining complicated concepts and answering students’ questions.” Others felt that Professor Liu was “unable to communicate the information properly,” and that the effort he undoubtedly put in did not translate into understanding.

The highly theoretical nature of the course was “challenging” and “frustrating” to some, but appealed to other students. Some pointed out that the supporting materials did not increase understanding, noting that “PowerPoints could be more extensive,” and calling the textbook “beyond useless.” Many felt that Professor Liu’s passion for and ability to explain game theory made that section of the course a clear highlight.

"Theories of consumer behavior, demand, production, costs, the firm in various market contexts, factor employment, factor incomes, elementary general equilibrium, and welfare.

Generally, students did not enjoy this class. It is a very ""math-heavy"" course with a lot of emphasis on algebra and calculus. One student said, ""The course was way too technical and hard to understand for students in Econ 101."" But some students did find the content ""interesting.""

Students by and large did not praise Professor Hanley’s teaching abilities. One student said, ""Professor Hanley is the nicest, smartest teacher. He clearly knows his stuff. That being said ECON101 is the first econ class where you need to understand calculus applications in economics. Some felt that the professor “could not relate to people who had only an elementary understanding of the material.""

Students generally found the material in this class to be difficult. The exams were fairly difficult. One student said it was because the students ""were not adequately prepared."" Also, the problems sets were very difficult and were hard to complete ""without extensive help."" The prerequisites are ECON 001 and 002; MATH 104 and either MATH 114 or MATH 115. Note: Incoming freshmen with AP or transfer credit for Econ 1 and Econ 2, MUST complete Math 104 and Math 114 or Math 115 before enrolling in Econ 101. Upper classmen must have at least a B+ in Math 104 to take Econ 101 and Math 114 or Math 115 concurrently. Most students took this class as a major requirement.

"The course provides facts and theories about the determination of per capita income and its differences across countries and across time. Then it moves onto the study of economic fluctuations in output and employment. Lastly, it examines the role of government in influencing these aggregate variables: monetary and fiscal policy.

Most students described the course as “challenging” and “mathematically based.” Quantitative and qualitative points are provided in class to make the content more interesting. The course goes into a lot of detailed description of macro-economic theories. A few students expressed their concern about the lack of time to prepare for the final because a lot of important information was presented in the last week. 

A large number of students enjoyed Professor Villaverde’s class and described him as a “fantastic,” “engaging” and “knowledgeable” teacher. However, some felt that he was not welcoming enough of questions. Professor Villaverde grades the exams and is said to be a tough grader with harsh re-grading standards. As a whole, most students enjoyed being in the professor’s class and said he is a great professor for upper-level courses. 

Most students found the homework “challenging” and “ambiguous” at times. Many wished there were more in-class examples to make sense of the material. The course is quite mathematically intensive and goes into detail on macro-economic theory. It is not suggested that a non-Economics major take this course due to the tough materials covered. The course intensifies in workload and comprehension towards the end of the semester.

"This course focuses on elementary probability and inferential statistical techniques. The course begins with a survey of basic descriptive statistics and data sources and then covers elementary probability theory, sampling, estimation, hypothesis testing, correlation, and regression. The class focuses on practical issues involved in the substantive interpretation of economic data using the techniques of statistical inference. For this reason empirical case studies that apply the techniques to real-life data are stressed and discussed throughout the course, and students are required to perform several statistical analyses of their own.


Overall, students found the course material “extremely boring,” but praised Professor de Paula’s ability to “make it relatively fun.” According to one student, “the class was kept on a clear and fair schedule.” Others, however, felt that the difficulty of the exams did not reflect the material on the practice sets and in-class examples.


Students called Professor de Paula “excellent,” “very helpful,” and “very organized.” Many appreciated his efforts to take material they found dull by nature and “somehow make it interesting and entertaining.” Students felt that he was able to “communicate the material well,” and appreciated his “good sense of humor.”


While some found the tests “challenging,” others felt well prepared by the problem sets and Professor de Paula’s accessibility. Several cited this course as their best experience with the Economics department, and seemed eager to recommend Professor de Paula’s class.

"This course is designed to introduce students to econometric techniques and their applications in economic analysis and decision-making. The main objective of the course is to train the student in (i) handling economic data; (ii) quantitative analyses of economic models with probabilistic tools; (iii) econometric techniques, their application as well as their statistical and practical interpretation; (iv) implementing these techniques on a computer. Students are required to perform several econometric analyses of their own.

Most students found the course both “interesting” and “useful”. However, several complained that while the course material was not technically difficult, the manner in which it was taught made it so. Some students regretted that they were not given a chance to use the practical applications of concepts and abilities learned in lecture. Some found that the exams were not adequate measures of what they had learned in class.

Several students praised Professor Cheng, calling her “focused” and “caring”. Another noted that she “explained the material well.” However, the majority of students found that she was unable to stimulate interest in her students, and that she was often inaccessible during office hours.

Most of the students taking this course were taking it for their major or minor. The majority of students would not recommend this course to a non-major.

Overall, students felt that the course material was “very interesting.”

Reactions to Professor Matthews, however, were mostly negative. One student felt that Professor Matthews “failed to stimulate many students' interest in the material,” while another felt he was “very dismissive” of students’ questions. Many expressed the concern that Professor Matthews “has trouble understanding what concepts may be difficult for students” and “blasts through huge amounts of content in minutes.”

Students described the course as “dry” and “boring”. The structure of the class, which consisted of the professor writing an equation on the board and solving it, was deemed unhelpful and “hard to understand”. Several students noted that part of the problem was that there was too much material that the course tried to cover and that it became “rushed” and “constrained.” 

Students found Professor Tang to be flexible with office hours and very patient. However, many did not enjoy his teaching style. They wished he would explain and analyze equations more and that he was not so rushed in his lectures. Some found that he did not respond to emails in a timely manner. Some students also found the equations he wrote on the board to be “illegible.” 

Many students were not happy with the course. They found that the T.As and the professor had different approaches to problems, which led to confusion.

"This is an advanced undergraduate course in models of economic growth. Students will be introduced to the workhorse theoretical models that are used to understand growth by modern macroeconomic researchers and policy makers. This course addresses a variety of questions about the economic growth of countries and builds theoretical models that can be used to answer these questions. There will be a strong focus on emphasizing the microeconomic foundations of models, and using the language of mathematics to express the underlying assumptions and assess their implications for policy, and on comparing the predictions of our models with the data.

Students described this course as “one of the best at Penn” with “a great mix of theory and empirical applications.” Students found the concepts interesting and somewhat challenging.

"This course explores international monetary economics with an emphasis on economic policy in an open economy. Topics covered in the course include: balance-of-payments adjustment, theories of exchange rate determination, the effects of exchange rate devaluation, macroeconomic policy under fixed and floating exchange rates, the Euro-dollar market, currency and balance of payments crises.

Several students described this class as one of the “best” and most “interesting” economic classes they have taken thus far at Penn. The course covers a lot of material in a short period of time, and is very fast-paced. The textbook used in the class was written by the professor, but students described it as very “outdated” and difficult to read and understand. Students had varied views about the practicality of the course.

Professor Ethier’s personality was generally described positively, as students complimented his “funny sense of humor” and described him as “nice” and “obviously very bright.” While students recognized that Ethier was intelligent and understood the material very well, many complained that he went over material “very fast.” The material was explained “clearly,” “efficiently,” and in a manner that stimulated interest, but the sheer speed at which it was explained made it necessary for students to resort to “struggling through” the difficult textbook in order to understand the material. Professor Ethier was not very accessible to students, and some students were disappointed that he did not offer review sessions for exams. Many students also expressed regret that Professor Ethier did not offer homework assignments or practice tests to help them better prepare for exams.

This upper-level economics class was not recommended to non-majors. It required a lot of reading, but there was no mandatory homework assigned. Students found it difficult to study off of notes they had taken in class, and no notes were made available on Blackboard. Thus, the textbook was the primary resource for studying, which was in line with exam content because it was written by the professor. Some students commented that exams were difficult, requiring very specific knowledge.

"This course intends to familiarize the student with the concept of ""law,"" its use as a constitutive and regulative force in the international arena, and the expanding scope of international law through the inclusion of transnational law and human rights. This course studies selected topics on developing economies related to models of growth and development, inequalities and poverty, population, human resources, the international sector and markets, institutions and policies.

Overall, many students did not enjoy the course content. Most students described it as “boring” and “dry”. It consisted mostly of comparisons between statistics of different developing countries. However, some students did comment that they enjoyed the assigned projects. 

Despite the unpopular content material, Professor Behrman did receive several good comments. Students described him as “nice and accessible” and “intelligent and caring,” especially during the coffee hours he sets up for students to ask questions. He is passionate about the subject matter; however, his slides are quite dry and boring. 

The workload for this class was not popular among the students. The exams were vague and were based on the large amounts of required readings. Most students thought it was difficult to study for the exam because they did not know what to expect and the course was not well organized.

"Traditionally, economics focuses on the study of existing markets. However, this course looks at the recent trend of regulators, entrepreneurs and economists being involved in the design of markets, the creation of institutionalized markets for new products, and the redesign of existing markets that were once dysfunctional. This course utilizes ideas from game theory and microeconomics to provide the theoretical underpinnings for design and analysis of such markets. Further, via real world examples, this course studies the practical aspects of such market design and the institutional details which can determine the success or failure of a design. 

Overall, this course was described as being challenging yet rewarding, helping students to hone their analytical skills. It was described as “one of the best experiences at Penn” due to the Professor and the intellectually stimulating material. Many students said that the real-life examples used in the class effectively linked theory and real-world application, thus enhancing their understanding of the material. 

The majority of students had nothing but high regards for Professor Pai. They reported that the professor and the TA’s were easily accessible by email and always up for answering questions. In addition, students liked the enthusiasm that Professor Pai had for the subject and for teaching. He was described as “helpful”, and one student described him as “passionate”, both about the subject as well as about his students. The professor aimed to learn the names of all of the students in the class during he first few weeks of the semester.

Students said the homework sets were often difficult, especially since you had to work through them alone, but each and every one of the students mentioned how much they got out of the class. The tests usually coincided with reviewed material, though sometimes questions referred to unreviewed homework and ungraded sets. The course was found to be heavily math-based and got progressively harder throughout the semester .This class comes recommended to majors and non-majors alike. One student’s review concisely communicated their opinion on the class: “Great course. Take it.”

"This course is a study of the economic facts and analysis of the medical care sector. This class is primarily an economics course and therefore an understanding and interest in economics is key. Topics discussed during the semester will include both description and discussion of problems in medical services pertaining to financing, delivery, and analysis of how medical markets work. 

Many students enjoyed this course but a select few found it to be somewhat repetitive in comparison to other health care management courses. Even so, one student described the course as fostering an “interesting viewpoint in which to approach concepts in healthcare.” 

Some students raved about Professor Kolstad, describing him as “outstanding” and “a good instructor.” However, others students commented that he was “not the most apt communicator.” 

The grade for the course is broken up into a midterm and final exam, short papers, and class participation. Students must complete ECON001 and ECON002 before taking this course unless exempt by the instructor. The course is open to both Wharton freshmen and upperclassmen. Overall, students recommended that those interested in health care take the course generally as the first class on the subject.

"This course is about strategically interdependent decisions. In such situations, the outcome of your actions depends also on the actions of others. When making your choice, you have to think what the others will choose, who in turn are thinking what you will be choosing, and so on. Game Theory offers several concepts and insights for understanding such situations, and for making better strategic choices. This course will introduce and develop some basic ideas from game theory, using illustrations, applications, and cases drawn from business, economics, politics, sports, and even fiction and movies. Some interactive games will be played in class. There will be little formal theory, and the only pre-requisites are some high-school algebra and having taken Econ 1. However, general numeracy (facility interpreting and doing numerical graphs, tables, and arithmetic calculations) is very important. This course will also be accepted by the Economics department as an Econ course, to be counted toward the minor in Economics (or as an Econ elective).

Generally students found the class material to be interesting. One student found it to be an ""incredibly interesting course that allowed [him] to think about real-world scenarios from a more theoretical perspective."" Some found ""the course content to be really fascinating.""

Most students had mixed feelings about Professor Dillenberger. One student said, ""Although Professor Dillenberger is passionate about what he teaches, he was difficult for me to understand,” because of his English. Professor Dillenberger tends to lecture as if ""teaching students of a very high level."" On the other hand, ""Professor Dillenberger did a good job trying to engage students by playing real games in class, and tried to make the problems have real world applications.""

The prerequisites are some high school algebra and Econ 001, but students recommend that those taking the course have a firm grasp of both algebra and calculus. Most students found the exams and problem sets to be very difficult. One student said, ""It's a hard class which requires a lot of effort, but that can be done, and done well, if one gives it their all."" Most students took this class to fulfill a major or minor requirement.

"Economics 001 is an introduction to economic analysis and its application. Theory of supply and demand, costs and revenues of the firm under perfect competition, monopoly and oligopoly, pricing of factors of production, income distribution, and theory of international trade are studied. 

Overall, a majority of students seemed to enjoy this “challenging, but very informative and stimulating” class. Many commented that “everyone should take an intro Economics course” because the knowledge is so useful and applicable. While students felt that a lot of effort needed to be put in to do well in this class, they felt that the grades reflected effort and that the knowledge gained was definitely practical. Some students felt the exams were tricky and “contained subtleties” that were not presented in lecture. Overall, most students stated that this was one of their favorite classes at Penn.

Professor Stein was described as “extremely engaging” and a “ball of energy.” She made the material, which could be somewhat dry, applicable to the real world and exciting to learn. It was noted that Professor Stein enjoys “challenging her students,” and thus expects a lot from them. Regardless, students were overwhelming positive in their reviews of her. Viewed as “phenomenal, helpful, and interesting,” many students recommend this course simply because of her. Some students did say that sometimes she was “vague and ambiguous” in what she specifically wanted you to know.

Students recommend this course to everyone, because it is a good introduction to microeconomics and has many real world applications that students found to be “useful in daily life.” The tests were seen as more difficult than the material presented, but overall, students really enjoyed this class.

"Economics 001 introduces students to microeconomics, with respect to the techniques and application of economic analysis. Students will learn about the theory of supply and demand, costs and revenues of firms in particular markets, pricing factors of production, income distribution, theory of international trade, and market types such as perfect competition, monopoly, and oligopoly. 

The majority of students applauded the interesting and varied content of the course. Many students noted the “large array of material covered,” but considered the material well presented and manageable. Several students, however, cautioned that practice problems and tangential concepts were difficult to master. Overall, most students appreciated the perspective that the class offered. 

Professor Stein was highly praised by most students. Many students appreciated Professor Stein’s ability to “stimulate student interest” and “present material in a clear, logical manner.” Several students appreciated that Professor Stein “is always available,” but “is not the type to coddle you.” One student found it particularly impressive that Professor Stein attempted to learn many of the students’ names in a large lecture course. A majority of students found Professor Stein to be both engaging and fair.

For many students, this was their first course in Economics. Nevertheless, several students cited previous introductions to Economics, such as AP classes, as advantageous. In general, the assessments proved “difficult,” but fairly graded. Many students would recommend both the course and Professor Stein to others.

Students in general found the subject a bit dry. The exams were challenging and the lack of a curve frustrated some students. Indeed, one student felt he would not get an A in the class, despite doing better than most other students.  

Professor Bossi, according to most students, enlivened the course material. Most found his injection of humor refreshing. One went so far as to attribute his decision to major in Economics to Professor Bossi’s teaching. A few students complained that he simply regurgitates the readings, but overall the feedback was positive.  

Most students in the course were freshmen. The only prerequisite is ECON001. The exams are challenging, but manageable. Assignments include weekly online work, two midterms, and a final. This course fulfills the Society sector and is the second course required for an Econ major.

"Economics 010 is divided into two main sections. The first part concerns microeconomic ideas such as opportunity cost, comparative advantage, supply and demand, importance of costs and revenues under perfect competition vs. monopoly, externalities, and public goods. The second part focuses on macroeconomic data, two models of the labor market, a model of the aggregate household, and the standard AD-AS model. Finally, there is a brief introduction to fiscal policy, banking, and the role of the Central Bank.

Evaluations for this course were mixed. Some felt it could have been more rigorous, while others concluded that it actually moved too fast. A background in economics seems to have helped students, as some without such a foundation felt disadvantaged. Students also suggested that combining microeconomics and macroeconomics might not be beneficial or practical. 
 
Reviews of Professor Spiegel also run the gamut. Most students felt that he communicated the material in confusing ways. As one student writes: “Professor Spiegel had a lot of great information to share with the class, but often it was often hard to follow his thought process and thoroughly understand the material.” The lectures were often dry. A few students thought that the professor held them back from understanding the material.

This class is the baseline economics class for Wharton students. It is populated mostly to exclusively by freshmen. It fulfills a Wharton requirement. Sentiments about the workload, as mentioned above, vary.

"Economics 101 covers many topics such as theories of consumer behavior, demand, production, costs, the firm in various market contexts, factor employment, factor incomes, elementary general equilibrium, and welfare. There is a very heavy dependence on the textbook readings and less on real world applications.

The general consensus of this class was that the material was interesting, but it was not as well taught as it could have been. Many of the students complained about the tests and their lack of coherence with the rest of the class. Many students found it “frustrating” that they did not know what was going to appear on the tests, and much of what did appear was not emphasized in class. Students agreed that the take home tests and the communication between TA, Professor and student needed to be a bit more organized. Overall, the main complaint about the course was its lack of structure, not the material or the difficulty level. Some students found that the material overlapped heavily with ECON 001, one of the prerequisites of the class.

Students complimented Professor Burdett for being a “respected economist.” However, they did not necessarily see him as highly engaging, available or a helpful professor. Though he was reported to often go off on witty, yet irrelevant, tangents, Professor Burdett often received a lackluster review. He did not respond promptly to emails and often mumbled so students had trouble hearing. In addition, the tests were graded slowly. Professor Burdett didn’t often use slides, which contributed to the feel of disorganization. On the other hand, it is clear to students that Professor Burdett is incredibly intelligent and “clearly passionate about economics.”   
 
This class is a “toolkit course.” It is mainly recommended for Economics majors or minors and provides a great deal of theory that can be useful later in studies. The workload consisted of five exams, both in class and take home. The prerequisites are ECON 001, ECON 002 and MATH 114.

Many students found the material “difficult to understand.” Several others noted that the course was “math intensive” and “focused far too heavily on mathematical formulas.” Several students found the textbook used for the course unhelpful for the exams and assignments.

Students were split on their opinion of Professor Hanley. Some students suggested “it was fun to be in class every day” and described Professor Hanley as having “incredible depth of knowledge in economics.” Others, in contrast, found that Professor Hanley did “not attempt to explain concepts or engage the class.”

Students found exam preparation difficult and exams themselves very challenging. Several students noted that class attendance seemed low, due to lectures failing to clarify material.

"Economics 103 focuses on elementary probability and inferential statistical techniques. It begins with a survey of basic descriptive statistics and data sources and then covers elementary probability theory, sampling, estimation, hypothesis testing, correlation, and regression. The course focuses on practical issues involved in the substantive interpretation of economic data using the techniques of statistical inference. For this reason empirical case studies that apply the techniques to real-life data are stressed and discussed throughout the course, and students are required to perform several statistical analyses of their own.

Overall, students had mixed reviews about this “challenging” economics course. Some thought it was helpful in explaining certain economic concepts, but some also believed it did not teach them anything helpful related to economics, and what they did learn, students taught themselves. The class was noted as “well-structured,” but “one of the most difficult” economics classes offered, as the class used PowerPoints and old lecture notes to convey the material. In addition, students were frustrated with the difficulty of the tests relative to the problem sets.

Professor Tang received mixed reviews as well. While most students agreed that he was “very approachable and helpful in office hours,” they conceded that during class he seemed unfocused and did not explain concepts well, stating that while some questions seemed to be “no-brainers” some students struggled to keep up simply because of the teaching style. And while many students felt he was relatively clear in his explanations, his accent was “hard to keep up with at times.”

Students had trouble with the grading of this class. The final was worth 50% of the grade, while each midterm was only worth 15%. This course was recommended for Economics majors only.

"Economics introduces students to econometric techniques and their applications in economic analysis and decision-making. This course teaches students how to analyze economic data, how to approach economic models with probabilistic tools, how to use econometric techniques, and how to apply these techniques through computer software. Students will become familiar with linear regression models, simultaneous-equations models, discrete choice models and univariate time series models. Students will perform several economic analyses on their own throughout the semester. 

Many students found the material for this course “tedious” and “dull.” Several students considered the problem sets difficult, but generally found the material to be well presented.

Most student spoke highly of Professor Cheng, citing an ability to “engage the class” and “review concepts at every chance.” Many students also praised Professor Cheng for being “quick to respond to e-mails” and “very willing to answer students’ questions during class.” Overall, Professor Cheng comes very highly regarded. 

Most students in this course were Economics majors. Many students were concerned that the problem sets and exams were challenging, but found Professor Cheng’s presentation of the material to be adequate preparation. The course was not recommended to non-majors. The prerequisites are ECON 101, ECON 103, and MATH 114.

"*Economics 212 is an introduction to game theory. The class explores strategic behavior in different contexts of social science. Trade, corporate strategy, and public policy provide examples and practical applications for the course.  

Students on the whole felt that the class had an interesting premise. One student complained that some of the concepts seemed to contradict each other. Another warned prospective students that the class picks up dramatically in the final third of the semester. 

A majority of students enjoyed and appreciated the passion that Professor Postelwaite poured into the material. One student, however, expressed concern about how busy the professor was and felt that he did not give enough attention to undergraduates.  

This course requires students to have completed MATH 104 and 114 or 115, as well as ECON 101.  Additionally, students cannot count this or any LPS course toward an Econ major unless they are registered as LPS students. Most students enjoyed the material but felt that the exams and problem sets were time-consuming and difficult.

"Economics 252 examines international monetary policy, emphasizing economic policy in an open economy. Students will learn about balance-of-payments adjustments, theories of exchange rate determination, effects of exchange rate devaluation, macroeconomic policy under fixed and floating exchange rates, as well as currency and balance of payments crises. 

Most students felt positively about the course material, claimed that the class included “lots of relevant information.” Many students found the textbook particularly useful, noting that it was ""clear and well-written.”

The majority of students praised Professor Ethier’s teaching. Professor Ethier focused on lectures with notes on the blackboard rather than PowerPoint’s or discussions, which several students appreciated. Many students also appreciated Professor Ethier’s “intimate knowledge of the material” and described him as very approachable. 

Most students considered the presentation of the course and its material fair. A few students noted, however, that the exams proved challenging, since all material was “fair game” for the exams. Some students felt that more practice materials would aid in preparation for the assessments. The prerequisites are ECON 101, ECON 102, and MATH 114.

"Economics 261 studies institutions in developing economies. The first section of the course covers the organization of production in traditional agrarian societies. Topics include land, labor and credit markets. The second section of the course focuses on the role of the community in facilitating the transition to the modern market economy. Here, students will study how the community spreads information, permits the formation of informal networks and organizes collective institutions, allowing individuals to take advantage of new economic opportunities.

This course had no lectures. Students conducted independent research either individually or in small groups and presented their work to Professor Behrman. Students found this course ""very helpful for developing research skills.""

Students enjoyed working with Professor Behrman and appreciated that ""he was always willing to talk to students about anything."" Numerous students felt that ECON104 (econometrics) should be a prerequisite for this class, for students without any background in econometrics felt at a disadvantage.

"Economics 262 course looks at the recent trend of regulators, entrepreneurs and economists being involved in the design of markets, the creation of institutionalized markets for new products, and the redesign of existing markets that were once dysfunctional, rather than the traditional study of existing markets.  This course utilizes ideas from game theory and microeconomics to provide the theoretical underpinnings for design and analysis of such markets.  Further, via real world examples, this course studies the practical aspects of such market design and the institutional details which can determine the success or failure of a design. 

Overall, this course was described as being challenging, yet rewarding. Students said the class started off “deceivingly easy” and got progressively more difficult. This was mainly due to the math heavy material later on in the semester. However, this did not detract from what students got out of the class. Many said that the real-life examples used in the class effectively linked theory and real-world application, thus enhancing their understanding of the material. Some wished examples were more concrete, especially for the harder concepts, but overall students found the class stimulating.

The majority of students had nothing but high regards for Professor Pai. They reported that the professor was easily accessible by email and was always open to answering questions. In addition, students liked the enthusiasm that Professor Pai had for the subject and for teaching. He was described as “awesome,” “funny,” and “energetic.” He engages all students and captivates their interest. Many students also complimented him on preparing them well for the exams and being so eager to help.  

This class comes recommended to majors and non-majors alike. It was described as “one of the best 200 level classes at Penn” due to the professor and the intellectually stimulating material. The prerequisites are ECON 101, ECON 103, and MATH 114.

"This course is designed to introduce students to econometric techniques and their applications in economic analysis and decision-making. The main objective of the course is to train the student in (i) handling economic data; (ii) quantitative analyses of economic models with probabilistic tools; (iii) econometric techniques, their application as well as their statistical and practical interpretation; (iv) implementing these techniques on a computer. Estimation and inference procedures are formally analyzed for simple econometric models and illustrated by empirical case studies using real-life data. The course covers linear regression models, simultaneous-equations models, discrete choice models and univariate time series models. Students are required to perform several econometric analyses of their own. 

As one student explained, “Econometrics is a great topic to learn about,” but it is “certainly challenging at times.” According to some students, the course was “too theoretical,” and there was “not enough practical application of the material.” Additionally, students felt that too much time was devoted to derivations of formulae and to less-useful statistical concepts. On the other hand, some students noted that they “learned valuable material.” 

Student opinion of Professor Krasnokutskaya was mixed. While some students considered her a “good professor” overall, others described her as “not very approachable” and not “particularly sympathetic to student problems.”

"This course is an introduction to game theory and its applications to economic analysis. The course will provide a theoretical overview of modern game theory, emphasizing common themes in the analysis of strategic behavior in different social science contexts. The economic applications will be drawn from different areas including trade, corporate strategy and public policy. 

Student opinion of the course material was mixed. While some students found the material intriguing, others thought it was too “abstract” at times. One student called the course content “fascinating,” noting that “some of the conclusions of some models were very interesting.” 

Students found Professor Matthews “very knowledgeable,” but also indicated that he could have stimulated student interest more effectively. Students also felt that the professor did not have a good sense of what elements of the course were more difficult than others, and thus spent too little time explaining the more complex ideas. Many students also expressed that they required extensive use of other resources, such as the textbook, in order to comfortably grasp course concepts. 

Students appreciated the variety of class formats, noting that simulations, movie clips, demonstrations, and games complemented lectures well. A few students were displeased with the grading structure, as one student stated, “Problem sets should be counted for a grade as well as the exams,” and another added, “The tests themselves were generally way harder than what was covered in class or the textbook.”",25890-001-342-STEVEN-A-MATTHEWS,STEVEN A,342-STEVEN-A-MATTHEWS,MATTHEWS,STEVEN A MATTHEWS,/instructor/342-STEVEN-A-MATTHEWS,42,46,/courses/25890/sections/1/reviews/342-STEVEN-A-MATTHEWS,2.87,2.24,2.40,3.00,2.71,2.33,2.84,3.32,1.97,1.84,,2.46,['ECON-212-001'],25890-001,GAME THEORY,/courses/25890/sections/1,ECON-212-001,001,2010A

Prerequisites include ECON101, MATH104 and MATH114 or MATH115, and ECON 103 is recommended. 

Students agreed that the course material was generally applicable to real-world situations. One student mentioned that the supplemental material on topics such as information asymmetry and health insurance “provided some thoughtful conclusions.” 

Several students expressed that they would have preferred Professor Fang’s presentations to be organized in a more straightforward fashion. On the other hand, some students believed that the professor was effective in connecting the material to tangible examples and that he is knowledgeable and friendly.

"This course examines the political and economic determinants of government policies. The course presents economic arguments for government action in the private economy. How government decides policies via simple majority voting, representative legislatures, and executive veto and agenda-setting politics will be studied. Applications include government spending and redistributive policies. Prerequisites for this course include ECON101, MATH104 and MATH114 or MATH115, and ECON 103 is recommended. 

Most students found the course material to be interesting and engaging. One student emphasized, “I feel like I have a very strong grasp on a lot of the tools needed to understand economics.” One student stated that this class was an “excellent course for any Economics major.” 

Students found Professor Azzimonti to be an effective instructor. As one student explained, “She explained everything clearly and went back to topics when students were confused.” On the other hand, some students felt that the pace of lectures was too fast, as one student mentioned, “I struggle to keep up writing my notes and don't have time to think it through in class.” 

Some students expressed displeasure with assessments. According to one student, “No extra exercises were given other than class examples,” and “there was no way for students to review the materials through algebraic exercises.” Furthermore, students found the final exam rather difficult.

Students overall showed a slightly negative view toward this class. They commented that the “course needs more structure,” and that it did not really explain concepts clearly. Other comments included that the “course is taught in an abstract way” and “is pretty fast-paced and challenging.” One student stated that the “readings had no correlation with the lectures.”

A majority of students thought that Professor Mylovanov's teaching could be improved, because it was his first semester teaching the course. He also had an “extremely heavy accent” and “wasted a lot of precious class time on tangents.” However, he “really cares about the students” and “is extremely accessible and approachable.”

Students expressed that “the concepts taught in the course are not, in and of themselves, difficult. However, the way they were taught made them seem much more confusing and daunting.” They also stated that the accompanied readings usually were not correlated well with the course material.

The study of economic fluctuations in output and employment.  The role of government in influencing these aggregate variables: monetary and fiscal policy.

A majority of students seemed to enjoy this “interesting” econ class that is on par with other econ courses taught at Penn. While the material is basic and required for all econ majors, students felt this particular course might be a bit too narrow in focus, wishing it would expand to other macroeconomic topics. Overall, however, students generally felt this course was a good one to take to gain a good knowledge of macroeconomics. One complaint was that they didn’t know where they stood in the class until the end.

A vast majority of students attributed their liking of the course to Professor Akcigit, whom they said, “really knows how to explain the math behind the issues.” He was very capable at explaining the material in a way that makes it “interesting and understandable.” It was noted however, that Professor Akcigit was hard to get into contact with, and was often 5-10 minutes late to class.

Professor Henkel was praised for his “leave no student behind mentality” and for his willingness “to meet with students outside of office hours.” He was nearly universally praised as committed to the class as well as providing “amazing handwritten notes.”

"This course examines the political and economic determinants of government policies.  The course presents economic arguments for government action in the private economy.  How government decides policies via simple majority voting, representative legislatures, and executive veto and agenda setting politics will be studied.  Applications include government spending and redistributive policies.

Students mentioned that this was the “best economics class I have ever taken at Penn” and “very straightforward.” The “lectures were fascinating,” although they usually exceeded the time allotted for the class and would “run over.” Another student commented that “the homework assignments and in-class examples help clarify how to do the problems and are very good practice for exams.”

Overall, students were enthusiastic about Professor Merlo’s teaching. They mentioned that he was a “great communicator” and that he “makes a potentially dry subject very exciting.” He is “an awesome lecturer” and “you can tell how passionate he is about the subject matter.” Professor Merlo, according to one student, is “the only Economics professor I've had at Penn who truly lives up to the incredible reputation of this institution.”

The course does not have assigned readings and is referred to by one of the students as having “very little work: just two midterms and a final.” The prerequisites are ECON 101; MATH 104 and MATH 114 or MATH 115. ECON 103 is recommended. This is an LPS 200-level course, which will not count for Economics Majors unless you are officially registered as an LPS student.",27269-401-344-ANTONIO-M--MERLO,ANTONIO M.,344-ANTONIO-M--MERLO,MERLO,ANTONIO M.

	Many students found ECON233 to be an ""interesting course"" and felt they learned a lot about the institutions of the labor market. Students found the content to be quite heavily math-based. 
	The majority of students praised Professor Burdett, describing him as ""really funny"" and an ""effective lecturer.""  One student described Burdett's funny lectures as a great way ""to brighten up your long winter days.""

"Prerequisite(s): ECON 101; MATH 104 and MATH 114 or MATH 115. Credit cannot be received for both ECON 036 and 234.  In addition, the LPS course, when offered, MAY NOT count for Economics Majors, unless you are officially registered as an LPS student. This course will use basic microeconomic tools to understand how the law often, but not always, promotes economic efficiency. Among the areas to be discussed will be tort law, property law, intellectual property, antitrust regulation.  The distinction between common law and legislative law will be drawn. 

Most students believe that while the course material was “relatively interesting,” the structure of the course was “slapdash” and “extremely disorganized.” Lectures relied too heavily on PowerPoints that weren’t very clear. Furthermore, the assignments and problems sets didn’t accurately represent the material learned in class. Students felt that the course could use some restructuring.

While most students agreed that Professor Garcia-Jimeno was “nice” they almost remarked that it was “overwhelmingly obvious that this was the first course he taught.” His grading policies weren’t as clear as they should have been and many students called him “abrasive.” It was often said that he read directly off the slides and was “unwilling to help students.”

Students said that the material for this course was interesting, but could have been presented in a different manner. It was often stated that a lot of calculus was necessary to do the problem sets, and that wasn’t a prerequisite for the course. Students would not suggest this course for non Econ/PPE majors.",27271-001-6084-CAMILO-GARCIA-JIMENO,CAMILO,6084-CAMILO-GARCIA-JIMENO,GARCIA-JIMENO,CAMILO GARCIA-JIMENO,/instructor/6084-CAMILO-GARCIA-JIMENO,32,35,/courses/27271/sections/1/reviews/6084-CAMILO-GARCIA-JIMENO,2.40,2.38,1.87,2.81,2.29,2.29,1.86,2.76,1.43,1.90,,2.86,['ECON-234-001'],27271-001,LAW AND ECONOMICS,/courses/27271/sections/1,ECON-234-001,001,2012A

"HCMG 302 (cross listed as ECON 236) provides an application of economic principles to the health care sector. By recognizing the importance of scarcity and incentives this course focuses on the critical economic issues in producing, delivering and financing health care. In particular, the course analyzes determinants of demand for medical care, such as health status, insurance coverage, and income; the unique role of physicians in guiding and shaping the allocation of resources in medical care markets; and competition in medical care markets, especially among hospitals. Special emphasis is placed on the evaluation of policy instruments such as government regulation, antitrust laws, 'sin taxes' on cigarettes and alcohol, and public health programs. The course uses more advanced quantitative methods and formal economic theory.

Students thought the course was “very interesting,” and a few even described it as one of the best courses they had taken.  Several students noted that they “learned a great deal about all aspects of healthcare.” A few particularly liked the “structure of the class [which] allowed [them] to focus on learning the information” without being “bogged down” in work.  While a couple students enjoyed the guest lecturers, others noted that the professor was a superior lecturer.

Students universally praised the “fantastic” Professor David.  They felt he was a “great lecturer” and particularly appreciated his “great sense of humor” and “ability to stimulate interest in students.”  They felt that he was both “incredibly approachable” and “a leader in the field of health economics.”

A few students noted that the course required “minimal work” outside of class as there was not any required reading.  However, there were three homework assignments that “took around 4 hours each to complete” and one that “took around 10 hours” according to one student. A couple students mentioned that the homework was either “confusing” or “poorly structured.”  A few others noted that the class required “straight memorization of the slides,” but one noted appreciatively that the midterm “can only help [a student’s] final grade.”  ECON 1 & ECON 2 OR BPUB 250 is required as a prerequisite, and it is recommended that students have knowledge of calculus and basic microeconomics.  Students who take this course cannot also take HCMG 202 (ECON 039) for further credit.
