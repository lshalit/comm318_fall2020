"An examination of European social, economic, political and cultural development from 1500 to the present, with attention to Europe\'s impact on the rest of the world.

Students felt this class was “excellent” and “engaging,” but a few stated that there was far too much reading for an introductory level course. The only unanimous complaints were regarding the TAs, as many students wished that there was no recitation at all to allow for more lecture time.

Students found Professor Safley to be “animated and passionate” and described his lectures as “extremely interesting and stimulating.” His energetic demeanor appealed to many students and several claimed he is one of “the best lecturers” at Penn.

"An explanation of major themes, milestones, and debates in the history of the global community since 1300. Using examples from around the world, the course will explore such issues as the causes of war and revolution; the impact of religion, science and technology on human communities; the development of global systems of slavery, colonialism, and labor migration; the rise of nationalisms; and perceived differences between \""East\"" and \""West,\"" and \""tradition\"" and \""modernity.\"" The course will also introduce students to the art and science of historical inquiry using primary sources, maps, pictures, and material culture.

Students stated that they “thoroughly enjoyed” this course and felt they came away learning a great deal from it. Many said the class was “engaging” and agreed that taking it was a “worthwhile experience.” Some thought the lecture was “badly organized” but many felt that, overall, the course “covered a lot of material in a way that is manageable and interesting.” While a few students expressed that “the amount of reading was a bit too much at times,” they acknowledged, “the content was well appreciated” and referred to this course as “an exciting journey in history!”

Most students praised Professor Cassanelli’s enthusiasm, and described his lectures as “passionate” and “engaging,” but felt they were, at times, unorganized. The general opinion was overwhelmingly positive and one student summed up Professor Cassanelli by saying he is an “amazing teacher and one of the few professors that has ever voluntarily come to recitation.”

"This course covers the social, political, and economic history of the nation from the Civil War to the present. Topics to be discussed include the causes and course of the Civil War, Reconstruction, politics in the Gilded Age, late nineteenth-century urbanization and immigration, Populism, Progressivism, the sociology and politics of the twenties, the New Deal, post-World War II America, the turbulence of the sixties, and contemporary affairs.

In general, students gave the class “two thumbs up.” The readings for the class—which consisted of material from both textbook and a bulk pack—got mixed reviews in terms of both quality and relevance to the course. Most students felt that they got a good survey of this historical period. However, some were dissatisfied with the lack of depth of analysis into certain events, and that there seemed to be few unifying themes in the course.

Unfortunately, the “fantastic” Professor Kropp will not be teaching at Penn any more, a fact that dismayed many of the students. Her use of multimedia—which included documentary clips, primary sources, and music from the period they were studying at the start of each class—was a major source of positive feedback.

Students uniformly thought the class was not difficult, although it was still “stimulating.” Most thought it was an appropriate first course in the History department because it relied on material students would know from high school.",15887-001-641-PHOEBE-S-KROPP,PHOEBE S,641-PHOEBE-S-KROPP,KROPP,PHOEBE S KROPP,/instructor/641-PHOEBE-S-KROPP,80,88,/courses/15887/sections/1/reviews/641-PHOEBE-S-KROPP,2.65,3.04,2.73,2.12,2.81,3.00,2.84,3.22,2.87,2.75,,2.47,['HIST-021-001'],15887-001,US HISTORY 1865-PRESENT,/courses/15887/sections/1,HIST-021-001,001,2009A

"This course surveys Latin American and Caribbean history from the Haitian Revolution of 1791 to the present. It examines the legacy of Spanish colonialism and slavery, movements for national and cultural independence, twentieth-century radicalism, and the politics of race in contemporary Latin America. Readings include fictional as well as analytical representations, and a film series.

Most students--many interested in Latin American history--were only moderately satisfied by this course. As one student put it, “It is supposed to do the impossible task of covering 2 centuries of history of an entire region.” Several students mentioned that they left class more confused than when they came in. “I feel like I\'m well-read on a small handful of events in Latin America,” another student wrote, “But I don\'t really have a sense of the history of the region holistically.”

Professor Farnsworth-Alvear was described as “wonderfully entertaining” and someone who “clearly really knows her Latin American history.” However some said her familiarity with the subject matter was a hindrance to some extent. “It is her brilliance that made it impossible for me and many other students to get anything out of this course,” one student wrote. Her tendency to speak too fast during lecture was also troubling to many students in this course.

The class consisted of a mix of history majors as well as other students. One history major was displeased with the construction of assignments, since “they seemed dumbed down.” Other students did appreciate the creativity of their paper topics.",15889-401-1511-ANN-C--FARNSWORTH-ALVEAR,ANN C.,1511-ANN-C--FARNSWORTH-ALVEAR,FARNSWORTH-ALVEAR,ANN C.

"This course will survey the major political, economic, social, and intellectual trends responsible for the making of modern Japan. Special emphasis will be given to the turbulent relationship between state and society from 1800 to present.&#8232;&#8232;
Students found this course to be “very interesting.” Assigned novels made “good supplements” and were “interesting” from a cultural standpoint, but essay prompts and most other assignments were “not useful.” The midterm exam “required more memorization than analysis,” and many felt they had to cram because the post-WWII material seemed “rushed.” Despite this, students reported that they “truly learned a lot” and enjoyed exploring a new topic.
&#8232;&#8232;Professor Dickinson is “very knowledgeable,” and “passionate about Japan.” Some felt he conveyed the material in a “stimulating manner” by exploring from multiple perspectives. His enthusiasm and interest in the subject matter is contagious. He “lives, breathes, and seems to function on a day-to-day basis solely on modern Japanese politics.” Some students found this to be “engaging” while others believe it inspired him to “go on tangents.” He had a “tendency to rant on unrelated topics” at the expense of course material; for this reason, some students found his lecture style “hard to follow.” Further more, he wasted time on administrative issues so that “15-30 minutes of every class goes by” before the real lecture begins. &#8232;&#8232;
This class may not be for those without any interest in history. Very few students were troubled by the workload, but they did express a desire for “a little less writing” and perhaps an accompanying recitation. While some “did not find this course stimulating at all,” others called it “interesting” and “a delight.”",15890-401-619-FREDERICK-R--DICKINSON,FREDERICK R.,619-FREDERICK-R--DICKINSON,DICKINSON,FREDERICK R.

"This lecture course, the second of a two-part sequence, provides a broad survey of China’s political history and social change from the fall of the imperial order to the \""market socialism\"" of today. It includes themes such as the interplay of new and traditional forces; the political role of new social classes; the search for viable models; war with Japan, civil war, and rural revolution; socialist construction and the development of the two-line struggle; the impact of Cold War; the Cutural Revolution; the opening to the West, economic reforms, and social ferment since the death of Mao.&#8232;&#8232;
This “fun” and “interesting but tough” course provides an in-depth look at the history or China. Assignments include short essays and midterm and final exams. With so much material to cover, lectures remain “vague,” while readings prove to be most valuable. Overall, most called the class “disorganized,” with “digressive” lectures and “pointless” in-class role-plays. Still, students report that it improved their critical thinking and knowledge of Chinese history.&#8232;&#8232;
Professor Fei is “knowledgeable,” “sweet,” and “approachable.” She was “great one-on-one,” but “a large lecture is not suited to her style.” Students disliked her unstructured, dense, and speedy use of PowerPoint, and she does not post slides or handouts online. Some complained that Professor Fei often rambled and “consistently ran the class well over time,” but appreciated how she “combines real-life experience with theoretical discourse to engage her students in a unique way.” One student called her “one of the best professors at this institution.”&#8232;&#8232;
The course has an “astronomical” amount of “dense” reading; although some were important, one “can get by without doing some of the other readings.” Lectures had “lot of jumping around without any strong emphasis on what we should know.” It was “difficult to know where one stands grade-wise.” One student commented that it was challenging for someone who does not know Chinese to hear and differentiate all of the names and places immediately. In sum, it was a “fair” and “very interesting” course that “more American students should take.”",15891-401-2997-SI-YEN-FEI,SI-YEN,2997-SI-YEN-FEI,FEI,SI-YEN FEI,/instructor/2997-SI-YEN-FEI,89,91,/courses/15891/sections/401/reviews/2997-SI-YEN-FEI,2.58,2.27,2.22,2.17,2.75,2.39,2.39,2.82,2.20,2.16,,2.55,"['HIST-097-401', 'EALC-047-401']",15891-401,CHINA IN THE 20TH CENT,/courses/15891/sections/401,HIST-097-401,401,2009A

"This course, designed for first and second year students, continues the history of modern Europe from the high point of Empire and world domination at the end of the nineteenth century to collapse and ruin in 1945. The grand societies and rich states which composed the European state system in 1890 destroyed themselves in these fifty-five years. As many as eighty million Russians, Germans, Poles, Yugoslavs, Greeks, Italians and other Europeans died in slave- labor camps, and six million Jews were systematically murdered. Europe\'s flourishing Jewish community east of the Rhine was wiped out. On the 9th of May 1945, the day Nazi Germany surrendered, the once prosperous continent was a smoking ruin, covered by rubble, pock-marked by craters and full of miserable starving people. This course will try to explain how and why Europe committed suicide in such a horrific way. It will cover Fascism, Nazism, Stalinism, the two world wars, the great economic depression, and the Holocaust.

Students found the course material “straight-forward, yet still quite interesting.” They also appreciated the “fantastic primary readings” which “did a lot to deepen… understanding of the issues discussed during lecture.” The amount learned from this course was above average.

Students found Professor Mercer to be a “great professor” and a “top-tier lecturer,” able to communicate “a tremendous amount of course material in a short bi-weekly lecture class.” One student appreciated that he took the time to write extensive comments on essays and found him to be very accessible.

The difficulty of this course was relatively low. The work consisted of readings and essays.

"A broad introduction to the history of Jewish civilization from its Biblical beginnings to the Middle Ages, with the main focus on the formative period of classical rabbinic Judaism and on the symbiotic relationship between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

Students found the material in this course to be very engaging and cohesive. A few complained that the course matter disregarded alternative “biblical scholarship theories.” One student found that “if you are already well versed in the Biblical text and rabbinic literature and the history of the region, the course falls a little flat.” On the whole, students were impressed by the quantity and quality of the course material.

Students found Professor Dohrmann to be “excellent.” One student wrote that “she commands the room with her dynamic presence and her knowledge.”

The work required in this course was moderate and consisted of outside reading and exams, as well as a final paper.

"This course covers the major events, issues, and personalities in Afro-American history from Reconstruction to the present. It examines the different slave experiences and methods of black resistance and rebellion in various slave systems. &#8232;&#8232;
Across the board, students loved this course. Rave reviews call it “excellent” and “highly informative,” noting that they really enjoyed the class, professor, and reading assignments. One student said, “I absolutely hate history, but she made it worthwhile.” &#8232;&#8232;
Students found Professor Savage “very knowledgeable” and “a great professor.” They also appreciated Professor Savage’s willingness to engage with students and her focus on class participation. “When students show passion for the material,” one said, “she helps them to nurture it.” &#8232;&#8232;
Reviews did not mention the difficulty of the course or work required for it. One student warned that students with a lot of prior coursework in Africana Studies might find this class “elementary and at times tedious,” but another who had taken multiple such courses “still learned so much.”",15902-401-1867-BARBARA-D--SAVAGE,BARBARA D.,1867-BARBARA-D--SAVAGE,SAVAGE,BARBARA D.

"This course aims to create an interactive website that will grow as a collective portrait of families and individuals who have had histories in West Philadelphia. The creation of this website is the basis of the seminar. Students will engage in research and contribute critical texts to the website which is intended to be a virtual heritage museum for members of the West Philadelphia community as well as and educational resource.
Students were generally disappointed with “West Philadelphia Community History.” While a few praised the valuable research skills they gained and a solid number expressed satisfaction with their outside-the-classroom experience, most felt the class did not meet its potential. Some students observed that their classmates did not take the course seriously, noting a lot of absences and lack of preparation for discussions. One student said it was “by far the most lax” of the history seminars taken. Students appreciate that they learned a lot about researching and interviewing. Most students felt the work they did outside of class — such as “getting out in West Philadelphia and meeting community leaders” — was most valuable and enjoyable. One student noted that the majority of things learned from the course happened outside of the classroom.&#8232;&#8232;
In general the reviews of Professor Lloyd and Professor Engs were not positive. Students noted that both professors seemed to come to class unprepared, without having much to talk about or have students discuss. They did not feel that class time was used productively; even a student who called the class “great” thought class time should be cut in half. One said that “going to class was a complete waste of my time.”
Some students complained about the lack of direction for the course, such as not getting a proper syllabus and not receiving clear instructions for the final paper. &#8232;While students say the class is not hard, it does involve time commitment outside of class for research and interviewing.

"This course examines the history, politics, and significance of foreign aid to Africa since the late 19th century. While we do not typically think about the European colonial period in Africa in terms of 'foreign aid,' that era introduced ideas and institutions which formed the foundations for modern aid policies and practices. So we start there and move forward into more contemporary times. In addition to examining the objectives behind foreign assistance and the intentions of donors and recipients, we will look at some of the consequences (intended or unintended) of various forms of foreign aid to Africa over the past century. While not designed to be a comprehensive history of development theory, of African economics, or of international aid organizations, the course will touch on all of these topics. &#8232;&#8232;

Student responsibilities include a weekly on-line journal, three 3-page essays on topics to be assigned, and a 10-12 final paper on a topic related to one of the course's many themes. Several students agreed that this course is on a “great topic,” and students seemed to really enjoy the many guest lecturers.""

Many students seemed to think that Professor Cassanelli is an “excellent instructor.” However, some students complained about Professor Cassanelli’s “unorganized,” sometimes “hard to follow,” and “off-topic” lectures, which may have made it “difficult to develop a cohesive view of the subject.” Regarding his accessibility, students commented that Professor Cassanelli went “above and beyond” to ensure the interests and knowledge of his students were met. Professor Cassanelli was also known to take time to meet with his students outside of class. Overall, students agreed Professor Cassanelli is “very intelligent and passionate about African history.”&#8232;&#8232;

This course is cross-listed with HIST 542, AFST 372 and AFST 542.

"Most of the students loved Professor Granieri’s class and said that it had exceeded all their expectations. “This course has been one of the most enriching and challenging courses of my academic career.” Students said that in their weekly seminar they would “discuss the nature of studying history, their favorite things about history and what they foresaw as the focus of their senior theses.” Not one student had anything negative to say about the course.

Students were excessive in their excitement over Professor Granieri’s teaching. Students noted that the Professor was, “exceptionally engaging, brilliant, supportive and willing to discuss material outside of class time if need be.” It was accepted that the class was so amazing because of Professor Granieri’s excellent teaching style and accessibility. The majority of students commented that Professor Granieri was an excellent mentor when it came to writing a thesis.

Some students did say that while weekly readings and assignments were not overwhelming, the “entire project is fairly daunting.” They thought that the class was challenging yet rewarding, and clearly enjoyable.",15919-301-2180-RONALD-J--GRANIERI,RONALD J.,2180-RONALD-J--GRANIERI,GRANIERI,RONALD J.

"History of International Relations Since World War I examines European diplomacy since 1914 from a global perspective through analysis of three major events: World War I, World War II, and the Cold War. The course covers the origins, conduct, and aftermath of World War I and II, and the effects that the European Great Power rivalries had on world politics.

Students had virtually nothing negative to report on this “engaging” course and a professor who “truly brings the course concepts to life.” While students weren’t necessarily fans of each reading section, they noted that the lessons were “highly interesting” and “pertinent to today’s political society.”
Students lavished praise on Professor McDougall, calling him an “absolutely wonderful” instructor who “makes the material come alive with his lectures.” Students appreciated his storytelling skills along with his “organization of the course and detailed outlines,” which gave the lessons structure.

Few of the students indicated any concerns regarding the course’s workload; one pointed out that the “amount of reading is expected” for a history class. A student acknowledged that “having a final exam be worth 50% of your grade” was challenging, but most ultimately showed little unease about the course’s grading.",15923-001-604-WALTER-A-MCDOUGALL,WALTER A,604-WALTER-A-MCDOUGALL,MCDOUGALL,WALTER A MCDOUGALL,/instructor/604-WALTER-A-MCDOUGALL,52,59,/courses/15923/sections/1/reviews/604-WALTER-A-MCDOUGALL,3.10,3.67,3.51,2.71,3.14,3.71,2.98,3.76,3.06,3.41,,2.37,['HIST-421-001'],15923-001,EURO INT'L REL SINCE WWI,/courses/15923/sections/1,HIST-421-001,001,2009A

Many students reported that this course was one of the best they have taken at Penn—one enthusiastic alum said that the course was “why Penn is worth the money.” Many agreed that the material was “enlightening,” while one student called the course “life-changing.”

Students raved about Professor Childers, saying everything from “[his lectures are] the only reason I get out of bed sometimes” to “this man is a genius.” The course was described as “captivating,” “phenomenal,” and “rewarding,” thanks to Professor Childers’ “masterful” instruction.

The only complaints about this course were regarding the assignments and grading. Some students expressed concern about TAs giving different assignments to each recitation, calling TA selection “a mixed bag.” Students noted “unnecessarily harsh” grading on exams and papers; one remembered that “most students came out of the midterm thinking they did well but the average grade was a ‘B’ at the highest.” Others complained about readings that were either “surprisingly weak” or “overwhelming” in quantity.

"While many students felt strongly about how great this class was, others had some complaints. Some felt that the class wasn’t very coherent as it, “wandered aimlessly through Roman history.” Some others mentioned that the readings were “excessively dry” and that there was simply too much reading to keep up on. Still, many of the students loved the class, saying that Professor McInerney’s lectures “blend the witty and provocative, the ancient and modern, to spur the interest of both classics majors and engineers. “

While some students had mixed feelings about the class, everyone agreed that Professor McInerney was an amazing teacher. Many said he was a “damn good professor” and is “one of the best at Penn”. Many students remarked that he constantly seemed to be in a good mood and that he was always ready to spice up the lectures with a joke or two. However, some did complain that he spoke quickly and moved through the content very fast and it was difficult to take notes in lecture.

While most students loved Professor McInerney and his class, some did complain that there was simply “too much work for an 027 history class.” Another student complained that the quizzes were too nitpicky, and would focus on one line from a reading of 150 pages. Still, another student said that “as long as you stay on top of the readings and do the few papers that there are (one response paper, a term paper and a midterm in class essay) and do well on the final, it’s a really enjoyable class.”",15302-401-84-JEREMY-JAMES-MCINERNEY,JEREMY JAMES,84-JEREMY-JAMES-MCINERNEY,MCINERNEY,JEREMY JAMES MCINERNEY,/instructor/84-JEREMY-JAMES-MCINERNEY,221,236,/courses/15302/sections/401/reviews/84-JEREMY-JAMES-MCINERNEY,2.93,3.61,3.24,2.76,3.13,3.69,2.81,3.54,2.94,3.70,,2.89,"['ANCH-027-401', 'HIST-027-401']",15302-401,ANCIENT ROME,/courses/15302/sections/401,ANCH-027-401,401,2009A

"This course explores the cultural history of the Soviet Union from the end of the Second World War to the collapse of communism in 1991. It investigates a variety of strategies of resistance to state power as well as the sources of communism’s enduring legitimacy for millions of Soviet citizens. Assigned texts include memoirs, manifestos, underground and officially approved fiction and poetry, films, works of art, and secondary literature.
Students enjoyed the “interdisciplinary approach” taken in the course that “allowed students to analyze issues from a broad array of viewpoints.” Students commented that discussions, field trips, and guest speakers truly added to the course and “facilitated learning.” However, the reading assignments, which included two full bulk packs and several additional books, were described as overwhelming. Another viewpoint was that although there were so many readings, the course did not provide enough writing assignments to help students understand the material.

The course was co-taught and students believed that “Professor Platt and Professor Nathans’s teaching styles compliment each other nicely.” Having two professors teach this interdisciplinary course let students see two different perspectives on every subject covered. They were “very intelligent professors with obvious interest and love for the subject.” Professor Nathans “speaks less” than the other professor but he was highly praised for his efficiency for he “tends to be more focused and clear about the point he is trying to make”. Furthermore, students enjoyed the academic atmosphere created by the professor.
The course introduced students to a broad study of Soviet history. For non-majors, however, the primary documents and other reading assignments could be difficult. Students recommended a previous knowledge of Soviet history in order to fully enjoy the class.",16427-401-1492-BENJAMIN-NATHANS,BENJAMIN,1492-BENJAMIN-NATHANS,NATHANS,BENJAMIN NATHANS,/instructor/1492-BENJAMIN-NATHANS,12,12,/courses/16427/sections/401/reviews/1492-BENJAMIN-NATHANS,3.00,3.58,3.00,3.42,3.50,3.50,2.75,3.17,2.42,3.25,,3.58,"['RUSS-260-401', 'HIST-413-401']",16427-401,USSR AFTER STALIN,/courses/16427/sections/401,RUSS-260-401,401,2009A
"This course explores the cultural history of the Soviet Union from the end of the Second World War to the collapse of communism in 1991. It investigates a variety of strategies of resistance to state power as well as the sources of communism’s enduring legitimacy for millions of Soviet citizens. Assigned texts include memoirs, manifestos, underground and officially approved fiction and poetry, films, works of art, and secondary literature.
Students enjoyed the “interdisciplinary approach” taken in the course that “allowed students to analyze issues from a broad array of viewpoints.” Students commented that discussions, field trips, and guest speakers truly added to the course and “facilitated learning.” However, the reading assignments, which included two full bulk packs and several additional books, were described as overwhelming. Another viewpoint was that although there were so many readings, the course did not provide enough writing assignments to help students understand the material.

The course was co-taught and students enjoyed the “very intelligent professors with obvious interest and love for the subject.” Having two professors teach this interdisciplinary course let students see two different perspectives on every subject covered. Students described Professor Platt as a fun teacher, although sometimes he “can be unfocused and ramble.” However, this characteristic of the professor complimented his partner in teaching the course, therefore making the class much more fun and educational.

"The course explores the emergence of modern science fiction, the ways it has reflected our evolving conceptions of the universe, and its role as the mythology of modern technological civilization. Topics include: \""Science & Utopia,\"" \""The Discovery of the Future,\"" \""Imagining Mars,\"" \""SF, Robots, & the Class Struggle,\"" \""Superman & the Ubermensch,\"" \""The American Hero,\"" \""The Golden Age,\"" \""Cold War SF\"" and \""Gods, Aliens & Destiny.&#8232;&#8232;
The course received overwhelmingly positive reviews. Words like “incredible”, amazing,” and “fantastic” were used to describe the course. More than one student even called it their favorite course at Penn. “If you are tired of reading boring books for literature classes but still find yourself in need of one or wanting one, then this is the course for you,” said one student. While the course has a significant amount of reading and a weekly response paper, most students felt that the work was well worth the effort.&#8232;&#8232;
Professor Adams, like the course, received very positive reviews. Students described his teaching as “focused, in context, and appropriate” to the assigned reading, and said that he was “entertaining,” and “knowledgeable.”
Some students felt over-whelmed by the amount of material, both assigned and in lectures, and some students mentioned they could have benefited from more information on Blackboard. The course consists of a good deal of work, requiring two books to read per week and a response paper. In addition, there was both a midterm and a final, which some students complained was too much work to do in a short period of time.

"Urban development has been influenced by religious conceptions of social and economic justice. Progressive traditions within Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Humanism have yielded: (1) powerful critiques of oppression and hierarchy as well as (2) alternative economic frameworks for ownership, governance, production, labor, and community. Historical and contemporary case studies from the Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East will be considered, as we examine the ways in which religious responses to poverty, inequality, and ecological destruction have generated new forms of urban development.

In general, students thoroughly enjoyed Professor Lamas’s class. Many commented, “I may have learned more in this course alone than all my other Penn courses combined.” Many students thought the lectures and discussions were outstanding, and one student went as far as to say that he “has walked out of every class felling alive, awakened and wishing that I could do this all day long and every day.” However, some students did wish that fewer topics had been covered, with a handful of topics being explored more in-depth. In addition, others wanted a “more detailed course description that accurately describes the course.”

The class unanimously loved Professor Lamas. One student noted that Professor Lamas “is a phenomenal teacher distinguished by his ability to concretize the subject matter for his students as it is relevant to our lives and the decisions we make.” Time after time, students remarked on Professor Lamas’s dedication and accessibility. Not a single student had something negative to say about Professor Lamas.

Students generally enjoyed the readings and felt that they were relevant both to class and to their everyday lives.

"This course studies the Russian Empire prior to the Revolution of 1917, exploring the rise of a distinct political culture beginning in medieval Muscovy, its transformation under the impact of a prolonged encounter with European civilization, and the various attempts to re-form Russia from above and below. Main themes in this course include façade vs. the reality of central authority, the intersection of foreign and domestic issues, the development of a radical intelligentsia, and the tension between empire and nation.

Students* who took this course described it as “great,” “amazing,” and “absolutely excellent in every regard.” Others noted that the class covered “very stimulating subject matter” presented by an equally stimulating professor.

One student commented that Professor Holquist’s “personal passion for Russian history really shows in his lectures.” The professor was described by students as not only a superb lecturer, but “enthusiastic and knowledgeable” as well.

This course requires a lot of reading that students admit is often “pretty dense,” but they agree that it is enjoyable nevertheless. The class itself is comprised mostly of students either majoring in the subject or taking it to fulfill the History & Tradition Sector requirement.

"This course will trace the history of the vast region of Latin America—consisting of more than twenty separate nations today—over the course of almost 330 years, beginning around the time of Columbus's first voyage and ending with the era of the ""wars of independence"" in the early 1800s. The class will explore how ""Latin America"" was born during the violent and confusing period of ""discovery"" and conquest; how contact among European settlers, native peoples, and enslaved Africans shaped social and political life in the Spanish and Portuguese colonies; how systems of labor as well as church and political institutions structured the lives of peoples in the region; and how political change and the ""revolutionary moment"" in the late 1700s resulted in the birth of more than twenty independent nations throughout the region by 1830. Students will also explore briefly, at the end of the course, how the colonial legacy continues to haunt Latin America even in the 21st century.

Students had mixed reviews to the course. Several reported that the class was ""incredibly dull"" and said they ""wouldn't recommend this course to anyone else."" Others, however, said that they ""certainly learned a lot from this course"" and that the lectures were very ""informative."" In addition, some students said that it was very difficult to have class discussions in a class of that size.

Many students found Professor Walker to be uninspiring, unable to stimulate student interest. Another student said that the ""Instructor basically goes over the course readings in class in a monotone voice with a PowerPoint."" However, other students did remark that Professor Walker ""did improve over the course of the semester.”

Most students thought that this was a very easy class. Several students said that, while there was a lot of reading, it was not necessary to complete the reading in order to do well on the midterm. In addition, students remarked that the course paper was only 2-3 pages long and ""didn't require any analysis."" However, students did say that there were pop quizzes on some of the readings.

Students commented that Professor Trout Powell was very knowledgeable in the subject and a passionate, inspiring instructor; however, several students did mention that she was hard to follow and jumped around in the material.&#8232;&#8232;

A few students commented that there was a large amount of reading, and one mentioned that “the fact that the class is divided into groups with different TA's created some kind of inequality with grading.” Another student also said the final exam was a lot of writing in a short period of time. Requirements are one paper and two take-home exams.",17492-401-3326-EVE-TROUTT-POWELL,EVE,3326-EVE-TROUTT-POWELL,TROUTT POWELL,EVE TROUTT POWELL,/instructor/3326-EVE-TROUTT-POWELL,128,145,/courses/17492/sections/401/reviews/3326-EVE-TROUTT-POWELL,2.94,2.77,2.90,2.64,3.19,2.93,2.71,3.46,2.89,3.01,,3.12,"['HIST-081-401', 'NELC-031-401']",17492-401,HIST MID EAST SINCE 1800,/courses/17492/sections/401,HIST-081-401,401,2009C

"This course covers the social, political, and cultural history of Europe during the ""long"" nineteenth-century from 1789-1890. Beginning with the French Revolution and ending on the eve of the First World War, the class focuses on long term developments such as the industrial revolution, urbanization, and imperialism as well as key events like the revolutions of 1848 and the Paris Commune. Readings draw on both primary and secondary material so as to introduce students to the m any divergent perspectives necessary to an understanding of the past.

Students nearly unanimously found Professor Steinberg's class to be a ""great course"" and incredibly ""motivating"". Most students found lectures to be ""thought provoking and neatly organized."" One student even said their only complaint was that ""lectures were only one hour long"".

Most students found Professor Steinberg to be an exceptional teacher. Students called him ""One of Penn's finest"" and said that his ""vast knowledge of the topic was impressive."" They also said that Professor Steinberg created a very open environment, in which ""students were encouraged to participate and it seemed the professor was talking to us rather than at us.""

Some students did comment that the reading took up a great deal of their time. However, with only a paper and a final, it was doable.

"A broad overview of American economic history will be provided by focusing on the following topics: colonial trade patterns, the growth of the market economy, industrial expansion, the political economy of slavery, the rise of the corporation, business cycles and crises, changes in work and labor markets, the advent of the regulatory and welfare state, deindustrialization, globalization, and the current meltdown of the American economy in historical perspective.

Most students enjoyed Professor Licht's course. One student said that he/she ""enjoyed the content and structure of the course and thought all the readings were very relevant and useful."" 

Many students loved Professor Licht's teaching style, commenting that it “makes this class worth taking.” Many students said that he was ""very nice"" and extremely ""knowledgeable."" Others, however, said that he did not ""promote diversity of ideas"" and that the key to the class was ""understanding Professor Licht's opinion is and repeating it back to him."" A few students commented that the class often went overtime.

Several students said that the ""readings range from long to excessively long."" Many students said that this would be a great class for Economics or History majors. Others remarked, ""This course is good for non-majors but does require some general background knowledge of U.S. history.""

"This course surveys the development of law in the United States to 1877. The emphasis is on the interaction between law and social forces. Such subjects as the evolution of the legal profession, the transformation of English law during the American Revolution, the making and implementation of the Constitution, and issues concerning business and economic development, the law of slavery, the status of women, and civil liberties will be included. This course is open to history majors and legal studies minors ONLY during pre-registration.

Students overwhelming loved this course. Many students thought that this was a ""fantastic course to teach anyone about the origins and workings of American legal concepts."" Many students said they enjoyed the discussions they had in class. They did, however, remark, ""you need to stay on top of readings as Professor Berry will randomly call on students to discuss certain aspects of the reading.""

Students were nearly unanimous in their love of Professor Berry. Many students said that she ""challenged us and asked some very thought-provoking questions."" They also said that she is an ""experienced and dynamic professor who is willing to make students squirm."" One student even said, ""you come to Penn to take classes like this one with professors like Mary Frances Berry.""

Several students remarked that this was a very challenging course and that you needed to stay on top of all reading to be successful in the class. However many said the readings were not too long-- about 10 to 15 pages-- and that it was worth reading.

"This course explores the history of the American South, from its formation and rise as a slave power in the Atlantic world in the seventeenth century, to the definitive defeat of the slaveholders' republic in the American Civil War. This course covers topics from the Atlantic slave trade; the emergence of slavery, the plantation system and the racial order associated with it; the development of African-American life under slavery; the particular relationship between masters and slaves in the antebellum period; the changing gender and class relations of southern society; the defense of slavery; and the unpredictable political road to secession. The course ends by focusing on the Confederate political project and its undoing in the course of the nation's bloodiest war.&#8232;

Overall students enjoyed this “interesting” class that they said helped them gain a better understanding of slavery in America. “I have never been so interested in learning about history,” said one student. The class was very well received, but several students complained that there was too much reading assigned each week and especially felt that during weeks with midterms or papers, the reading should be cut back. &#8232;

Students raved about Professor McCurry saying she was “one of the most brilliant individuals I have ever met, and it was truly an honor to take this class.” They appreciated her in-depth knowledge of the subject matter and her helpfulness during office hours, but they did recommend that she work to make her PowerPoint slides more helpful. &#8232;

This course fulfills a cultural diversity requirement. It is recommended for anyone with an interest in American History.

"This discussion and research seminar examines the competing and diverse currents of antistatist and radically individualist thought that have been a part of the Western dialogue from the nineteenth century to the present.

Students liked this “challenging” course. They appreciated the engaging lectures and interesting subject matter, but many emphasized that there was a lot of reading required. One student noted that “the reading (most of it spectacular) took over 50% of all the time I devoted to academics this semester,” but he added that, “I do not regret it since I had the opportunity to read astonishing material and to participate in a seminar with such high quality of students.” Reviews mentioned that students should be prepared to think critically about the reading but that “you come away having extracted knowledge for life.”

Students really appreciate Professor Kors’s in-depth knowledge of the subject matter. One student summed it up by saying, “He’s an incredibly knowledgeable and excellent professor, who knows how to run a seminar.”

The course requires active participation in discussion and two papers, one brief and one a longer research paper.

"This course examines the Cold War as a global phenomenon, covering not only the military and diplomatic history of the period, but the social and cultural impact of the superpower confrontation, from both the Western and Eastern perspectives. It covers the origins of the conflict, the interplay between periods of tension and détente, the relative significance of disagreements within the opposing blocs, and the relationship between the ""center"" of the conflict in the North Atlantic/European area and the global ""periphery,"" as well as the end of the Cold War and its historical significance.

For the most part students loved this co-taught class. On student called it “the best I have taken at Penn.” Students liked that the course covered a lot of different aspects of the cold war. “We managed to cover all the ground effectively and with a good level of detail,” said one student. Despite this, some students felt that the class was largely focused on the U.S. perspective and that the course “would have benefited from more Soviet texts.” 

Overall students loved Professor Nathans and Professor Granieri. “There's nothing like taking one course with 
two of the university's most renowned professors,” said one student. They appreciated how each professor brought his own perspective and expertise to the class and called lectures “fascinating” and “valuable.” One student did mention that having two professors created some confusion, but that “the combination of their two expertise made them quite a team.” Another student added that, “the dynamic between these two professors was fantastic. Both brought unique lecturing styles to keep the class particularly exciting.”

Reviews mentioned that the reading assigned was challenging. Several students also didn’t like the essay prompts assigned.

"This course examines the international politics of Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, up to the outbreak of World War I. It will address the transformation of European diplomacy with special attention to the rivalries between the great powers, the impact of nationalism and emerging mass politics, the interplay between military and economic power, and the relationship between the European powers and the rest of the world.

Students who have taken this course in the past have given it excellent reviews, describing it as “extremely interesting, focused, and well-structured.” Most agreed that the class was not only enjoyable, but a wonderful learning experience as well.

Students reported that Professor McDougall really “brought the course material to life through his lectures” in a format that was organized well and revealed his own devotion to the subject.

“A lot was expected of us, but this class was absolutely worth it,” one student commented. Many students who took the course agreed with this sentiment, noting that the reading was both informative and “stimulating.” Others observed that the coursework was free of any tedious busywork, and the assignments were “thoughtful, fair, and useful in the learning process.” This course is ideal for students interested in diplomatic and political history.

"This course explores the meteoric rise of Hitler's NSDAP in Germany, the nature of Nazi rule, and the final collapse of the Third Reich. The first half of the semester analyzes the appeal of the NSDAP, Nazi mobilization tactics, campaign strategy, and the content of the party's social appeals. The second half concentrates on the Nazis in power, their use of terror and propaganda, their ideological objective, everyday life in the Third Reich, and the possibilities of resistance. Special attention is devoted to Nazi Jewish policy and the steps that led to the ""Final Solution"" and the Holocaust.

Students who have taken this course have called it “amazing,” “fantastic,” and one student mentioned that it was “the greatest class I’ve ever taken at Penn.” The course was described by students as “engaging” and others reported that the subject was “fascinating.”

Students attribute most of the course’s success to Professor Childers himself, who is described by many as “an absolutely captivating lecturer” who delivers his lectures in a “storytelling-like style” and manages to end each class on a cliffhanger. Students also note that Professor Childers “is extremely accommodating and approachable with any questions outside of class.”

The class entails keeping up with a lot of reading, but students who have taken the course in the past recommend it to any student at Penn, particularly those interested in German and Jewish history.

"This course is an introductory history class that covers the story of Greeks, including various aspects from which our culture derives from: democracy, epic poetry, lyric poetry, tragedy, history writing, philosophy, aesthetic taste, etc. The class will cover the period from the late Bronze Age, c. 1500 BC, down to the time of Philip of Macedon, c. 350 BC, concentrating on the two hundred year interval from 600-400 BC.

Students commented that the course was very “demanding” and required more than they expected for an introductory history course. The course, based on primary source readings, focused heavily on literature and details about “pottery, trade, philosophy, etc,” rather than actual historical events. 

Student’s feelings about Professor McInerney were mixed. While some students commented that it was “one of the greatest teaching performances [they] have witnessed at this university,” and many called Professor McInerney an “amazing lecturer,” some students found it difficult to approach Professor McInerney with questions or comments. All students agreed that lectures were “interesting, informative, and highly entertaining” but a few students interpreted his “theatrics” as “arrogance” and were turned off by his demeanor.  Many praised Professor McInerney for his “animation” and ability to stimulate student interest.

Although students learned a lot in the course, many commented that the heavy workload and harsh grading of papers made the course too difficult for non-classical studies majors taking the course as a general elective. A few commented that though they worked hard in the course, they didn’t feel like their progress was rewarded when it came time to receive grades.  This course was recommended for majors or students greatly interested in Greek history. The class fulfills the History & Tradition Sector and there are no prerequisites.

"This course uses data from what is actually happening in the course of the semester to introduce the concepts and methods of the social sciences. It analyzes the current state of globalization and sets it in historical perspective. We will focus on a series of questions not only about actual processes but about the growing awareness of them, and the consequences of this awareness. In answering these questions, we will distinguish between active campaigns to cover the world (e.g., Christian and Muslim proselytism, opening up markets, democratization) and the unplanned diffusion of new ways of organizing trade, capital flows, tourism and the Internet. The body of the course will deal with a series of analytical types of globalization, reviewing both the early and recent history of these processes. The overall approach will be historical and comparative, setting globalization on the larger stage of the economic, political and cultural development of various parts of the modern world. The course is taught collaboratively by two social scientists: an anthropologist and a sociologist, offering the opportunity to compare and contrast two distinct disciplinary points of view. It seeks to develop a concept-based understanding of the various dimensions of globalization: economic, political, social, and cultural. At the end of the course students will understand the significance of globalization in the modern world, and be able to compare the approaches of different social sciences.

Students commented that the course, “covered all aspects of globalization and raised some interesting points,” but seemed “scattered all over the place,” and “often lacked focus.” Students agreed that the broad scope of the class and large amount of subject matter made it “hard to get interested,” and was “almost too much to cover in one semester.” Also, they described the lectures as, “pointless,” and difficult to follow. 

Students described Professor Spooner as, “boring,” and lacking, “the energy needed to hold one’s attention.” They found his lectures to be “random” and unrelated to the test material. 

Students commented that the readings for the course were, “interesting,” but there were, “too many readings some weeks.” They described the essay questions as “too broad,” and stated that the projects “weren’t explained very well creating confusion.” Students agreed that the course required a significant amount of outside knowledge and is best suited for juniors and seniors

"This course surveys the history of medical knowledge and practice from antiquity to the present. No prior background in the history of science or medicine is required The course takes a broadly chronological approach, blending the perspectives of the patient, the physician, and society as a whole—recognizing that medicine has always aspired to “treat” healthy people as well as the sick and infirm. 

Students appreciated the breadth of history that this course covered. One student even claimed that Barnes did an “admirable job in trying to cover thousands of years in one semester.” Another student stated that the course is “fabulous. Makes paying for Penn worth it.”&#8232;&#8232;

Students were very enthusiastic about Professor Barnes, using words such as “enthusiastic” and “engaging” to describe his teaching rhetoric. Several students acknowledged Barnes as their favorite Penn professor. Other students praised the new perspectives they were exposed to as a result of having taken this class. However, some students expressed frustration with the amount of material that the course hoped to cover.

Despite the majority of overwhelming praise given to the course and the instructors, the biggest complaint students had was the work load that was required of them: two extensive research papers, two midterms, and a final. Required readings consist largely of primary sources, from elite medical texts to patient diaries.

"This course explores the medical consequences of the interaction between Europe and the “non-West” It focuses on three parts of the world Europeans colonized: Africa, South Asia, and Latin America. What was the history of therapeutic practices that originated in Africa or South Asia? How did European medical practices change in the colonies? How did practitioners of “non-Western” medicine carve out places for themselves? How do today’s medical problems grow out of this history? This is a fascinating history of race and gender, of pathogens and conquerors, of science and the body. It tells about the historical and regional roots of today’s problems in international medicine.&#8232;&#8232;

Overall, students gave Professor Feierman’s course very positive feedback, appreciating especially the wealth of knowledge Professor Feierman provided. One student stated that the course “touched on a huge amount of issues.” Another student called it “one of my favorite courses I’ve taken in 6 semesters at Penn.” However, while students found the readings incredibly relevant and applicable, they also said that the workload could have probably been trimmed down.&#8232;&#8232;

Once again, students greatly appreciated the great deal of knowledge Professor Feierman presented to the class based upon his own experiences. Despite this, students also acknowledged that because of all of the information pertaining to the subject matter, sometimes lectures were too long for the course time allocated each session. Several students also made specific note to thank the TA’s, who were “incredibly valuable.”&#8232;&#8232;

The one consistent complaint students had about this course was the amount of required readings that were critical to doing well in the class. Students stated they felt “rushed to finish all readings,” and that some were “too long and repetitive,” despite the general interest they rendered.

"This course covers the social, political, and economic history of the nation from the Civil War to the present. Topics discussed include the causes and course of the Civil War, Reconstruction, politics in the Gilded Age, late nineteenth-century urbanization and immigration, Populism, Progressivism, the sociology and politics of the twenties, the New Deal, post-World War II America, the turbulence of the sixties, and contemporary affairs.

Many students felt that it was a “great class” that was “very interesting and stimulating.” One student said that, “the class was amazing, before taking the course I despised history but now I feel able to analyze and appreciate history more because of the issues addressed.” However, others were frustrated. The main point of contention was the subject matter. Many students found the course title misleading and felt that the class dealt more with cultural history than traditional history. Some yearned for a more “traditional” approach and others felt the class overlooked “political, socioeconomic, and race details crucial to the depiction of history.” Students appreciated the analytical skills they gained in the class though some felt there was a lot of reading.

Most of the students praised Professor Kropp as “interesting and engaging” as well as “organized and clear.” They applauded the variety of techniques she used in lecture, from music to movies and video clips. Students felt these mediums helped them identify with the periods discussed and brought the history to life. However, other students found Professor Kropp’s lectures to be “boring” at times. One student felt her lectures were “often labored, awkward, and uninteresting.” Another student claimed that Professor Kropp never responded to his e-mail.

This course is an introductory course. Students who usually did not like history thoroughly enjoyed the course, while others who claimed they “loved” US History were not satisfied. Some students felt some of the readings were not relevant and that there was a lot of reading. This course fulfils the history and tradition sector requirement and a regional requirement for the history major.",20307-001-641-PHOEBE-S-KROPP,PHOEBE S,641-PHOEBE-S-KROPP,KROPP,PHOEBE S KROPP,/instructor/641-PHOEBE-S-KROPP,44,57,/courses/20307/sections/1/reviews/641-PHOEBE-S-KROPP,2.84,3.05,2.98,2.34,2.91,3.00,2.98,3.09,2.73,2.70,,2.39,['HIST-021-001'],20307-001,US HISTORY 1865-PRESENT,/courses/20307/sections/1,HIST-021-001,001,2008A

"Over the last two centuries, the modern corporation has emerged as the dominant form of doing business throughout the world. As such, it not only effects people\'s daily lives, but also influences government policies and larger trends in society. This course looks at the history of the international corporation from the industrial revolution to the present, to consider how corporations have evolved and the varying ways in which they have influenced the history of our times. We will consider the fundamental debates surrounding the evolution of the corporate form, the role of competition, and the balancing of corporate responsibility between its shareholders, managers, workers, customers and, most importantly, society as a whole. Much of the course will involve an examination of case studies of individual companies, industries or issues, to understand how corporations have functioned in specific instances.	

A lot of students loved this class, calling it an “amazing class” and “one of the best history courses” they’d taken at Penn. Some, however, did complain about the class lectures, saying that they “skipped around a lot, which made it difficult to understand main concepts.” Others felt that the readings should have been discussed more in class and “more references directly to readings in class might encourage doing them.”

Professor Drew was declared by all his students to be an amazing teacher. Students commented that he had a “knack for communicating seemingly mundane subject matter.”  Others described him as “extremely flexible and available,” and also “very enthusiastic.” Students complimented Professor Drew for “making the topic interesting by using humor,” and doing “a great job stimulating class through discussion and with stories.”

One of the biggest complaints students had was concerning the amount of reading for the class. Many said that their “only criticism of the class would be that some of the readings are extremely long and we barely discuss them.” Several other students complained that “readings at times seemed to be peripheral” and that there was so much reading “it was hard to keep up.”",20316-001-614-JERRY-I--DREW,JERRY I.,614-JERRY-I--DREW,DREW,JERRY I.

"This course explores the motivation that let to the \'scramble for empire\' in the mid-to-late nineteenth century; the reason why a handful of relatively small European nation-states subdued much of the rest of the world with apparent ease; and why their empires melted away so quickly after 1945. Some case studies considered are the experience of the British in India and South East Asia, the French in North and West Africa, and the Belgians in the Congo. Readings analyze the political, economic, military, and cultural implications of empire from the points of view of the colonized as well as the colonizers.

Students thoroughly enjoyed this class. However, they were divided in their opinions of the readings and the structure of the course. Some students felt that the readings were “a nice balance of primary and secondary sources” and that they were “interesting.” King Leopold’s Ghost was a favorite. Meanwhile other students were frustrated with the reading. One student desired readings with more “relevant facts” and another wanted a “blanket text that touches or covers class examples.” Another student complained that the readings were “dense and not as comprehensive as lecture.” As for the structure of the class, some students enjoyed the balance between lecture and discussion. One student wanted more discussion while another complained that “lecture one day and discussion the other was inefficient. More lecture time was needed to have better discussion.” One student said discussions were “good though tough to comprehend,” and said that it was “a very difficult course but enjoyable.”

All of the students loved Professor Allport. They felt he was an “excellent teacher” who really “helped students out” and that he gave really “great, interesting lectures.”

"This course traces the history of the American South from the end of Civil War to the present. It investigates Reconstruction, the New South, Populism, racial disfranchisement, the rise of Jim Crow, the politics of the One-Party South, the South in the Progressive era and its role in the New Deal and World War II, the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, and the rise of the Republican South. While following the narrative of politics and economic development, it pays particular attention to race relations and takes a look at gender roles. In addition, it explores the Southern identity as reflected in popular culture and literature as well as in other corners of the public sphere. There are two lectures and a recitation section each week, as well as a mid-term and a final exam.

Most students really enjoyed this course. They found it “interesting” and “highly informative” and “fun to be a part of.” A student felt the course was a “thoughtful and in depth look at the South.” However, one student noted that there was “very little history, and a lot of TV.” Some students enjoyed the multimedia supplements while others complained that “numerous videos were no substitute for what should have been thought provoking lectures” and that “the dramatic change in the last 30 years was largely ignored; the movement of industry, education and economics was largely overlooked.”

Students adored Professor Hackney. They complimented him saying that he was a “brilliant lecturer” and that he “does a great job of using quotes, movies, music, and anything else he can find to help portray the American south the best way he can.” One student’s quote in particular can sum up sentiments of Professor Hackney: “He is truly one of Penn’s best professors. It is rare to find someone with such a vast amount of knowledge combined with a willingness to know and help his students.”

"This course examines the political, cultural, and intellectual history of America between 1954 and 1974. It considers the civil rights movement, the New Frontier and Great Society, the Supreme Court and right politics, the rise of the New Right, the debate over Vietnam, student radicalism, sexual liberation movements, black power, the counterculture, the urban crisis, and white backlash. The course emphasizes the transformation of liberalism and the revitalization of conservatism, and the tensions between integration and separatism, between libertarianism and communitarianism that shaped the social movements of the sixties.

The majority of students found this course to be “amazing.”  Students were unanimous in the opinion that Professor Sugrue’s lectures were “interesting and engaging.” Most thought the course did a very comprehensive study of the 1960’s.  However, some wanted more on the counterculture of the 60’s and wondered, “where was the sex, drugs and rock and roll?” 

While some students had mixed feelings about the class, all students found Professor Sugrue to be an “engaging and eagerly enthusiastic lecturer.” One student commented that “Sugrue’s enthusiasm and mixture of theory with anecdotes makes me wish I had taken more history classes.” Other students used words like “fantastic” and “animated” to describe Professor Sugrue, and referred to him as an “amazing historian.”

Several students noted that the “amount of reading was excessive and often not helpful.” Some also added that the course was “so much more work than was anticipated,” and was “overwhelming at times.”  However, the majority of students would recommend this for all other students, majors and non-majors alike.",20346-001-2779-THOMAS-J--SUGRUE,THOMAS J.,2779-THOMAS-J--SUGRUE,SUGRUE,THOMAS J.

"This survey course is based solely on primary sources from the main currents of eighteenth-century European thought which includes deism, natural religion, skepticism, evangelical revival, political reform, Utilitarianism, and materialism. The course focuses on works widely read in the eighteenth century and of enduring historical significance.

Students raved about this course. More than one student proclaimed that it was the best class they had taken at Penn. Many found the course “intellectually stimulating,” that it required “independent and critical thinking,” and that they learned a lot from it. One student did say that “the pace of the lectures could be faster and a more in depth historical perspective would be nice,” while another student yearned for more discussion. Both these students were in the minority. 

Students unanimously applauded Professor Kors’ teaching style. Not a single critique was given. All the students found him to be “brilliant, inspiring, passionate, an amazing lecturer.” They admired his expertise and in depth knowledge about his subject matter and the fact that he “genuinely cares about his students.” General sentiment can be summed up in one student’s proclamation: “Kors is as good as it gets. He is a professor who you’ll want to take at least one course with before graduating.”

The distribution of grades in this course was a point of concern for students. They wanted the distribution to become more balanced and not have the final worth 75% of their grade. 300-400 level courses are on special topics and are more advanced. They often presuppose some basic knowledge in the field and should be more difficult courses than courses at the 1-199 levels. ",20351-001-645-ALAN-C--KORS,ALAN C.,645-ALAN-C--KORS,KORS,ALAN C.

"This course examines the international politics of Europe in the 20th Century, the period during which Europe, beset by two devastating wars and the horrific experience of genocide, lost its dominant international position and was forced to adjust to a world dominated by extra-European forces. The course examines the decline and (partial) recovery of Europe\'s international position with special attention to the contrast between international competition and transnational cooperation within Europe, the impact of the two World Wars, the ambivalent legacy of the Cold War, and Europe\'s developing role in the post-Cold War world.

Most students enjoyed this course, calling it “engaging,” “dynamic” and saying it was an “extraordinary experience.” Some students felt that the course went through material too quickly, but most were very impressed at the amount of in depth material covered in this survey course.

Students unanimously praised Professor Granieri on his “excellent lectures” that were “interesting and stimulating, even at 10 AM” and “always pleasurable to attend.” Students also commented on his “surprising accessibility” and “good sense of humor.” In the words of one student, “Professor Granieri was the only legitimately witty professor I’ve ever had.”

Some students complained about the readings for the course, saying that they were “too long,” “dense,” while others felt that the readings were “interesting” and “useful.”",20352-001-2180-RONALD-J--GRANIERI,RONALD J.,2180-RONALD-J--GRANIERI,GRANIERI,RONALD J.

"The Roman Empire was unique in that although it unified many Mediterranean territories, these territories never formed a cohesive Roman state. The ancient Greeks were renowned for their accomplishments in disciplines such as democracy, philosophy, art, literature and drama. Contrastingly, the ancient Romans focused more on ruling their expansive empire and maintaining their imperialist grasp in the Mediterranean region of the world. This course examines the conquests, military campaigns, and decrees of the ancient Roman civilization from the year 300 B.C. to 0. Further topics include the socioeconomic and sociopolitical ramifications of ruling such an expansive empire as well as the transformation of the Roman Republic (Senate rule) into the Principate (emperor rule). The military, cultural, and political limits of Roman rule are also examined. Furthermore, the course examines the inception and evolution of a distinctive Roman culture, namely novel forms of literature (such as satire) and entertainment such as the gladiatorial arena.     

Some students remarked that the Power Points in lecture were hard to follow and occasionally included superfluous information that made the course “dry.” One student mentioned that they would have liked Professor Grey to “talk more about the end of the empire.” One student claimed that the course “seemed to require background knowledge that was advanced for an introductory course.” Similarly, another student mentioned “for an introductory history course, I felt that there was too much time spent analyzing literary tradition.”

Students praised Professor Grey for his “articulate” communication style and engaging lectures. Another student stated that Professor Grey’s “preparation for class was unparalleled” and that he was unequivocally “the most dynamic professor in my 4 years at Penn.” In separate instances, students mentioned that the course was “well taught” and that Professor Grey “really knew what he was talking about.” In a comparison to the Roman orator Tacitus, one student stated the Grey was “an oratorical expert.”  However, one student mentioned that Professor Grey could have interacted more with the lecture audience and that some students felt “removed.” 

Students stated that the assigned readings were both “useful” and “manageable”, and that the midterm was “fair.”",19726-401-2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY,CAMPBELL AINSWORTH,2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY,GREY,CAMPBELL AINSWORTH GREY,/instructor/2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY,98,136,/courses/19726/sections/401/reviews/2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY,2.75,3.07,2.84,2.66,2.59,3.21,2.80,3.31,2.26,2.78,,2.88,"['ANCH-027-401', 'HIST-027-401']",19726-401,ANCIENT ROME,/courses/19726/sections/401,ANCH-027-401,401,2008A

"This course is an examination of European social, economic, political and cultural development from 1500 to the present, with attention to Europe’s impact on the rest of the world. Readings included Diderot, Nietzsche and Montaigne, among others. &#8232;&#8232;&#8232;In general, students “enjoyed” this course, which they described as “interesting,” “well structured,” and “very good.” Students reported that the course remained “stimulating” despite being “extremely factually based” and covering a “tremendous amount” of material. It was able to cover an expansive historical time period yet still be “brilliantly detailed.”&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;Most students really enjoyed Professor Safley’s teaching style, and several students described him as an “excellent lecturer and teacher.” Students found Professor Safley to be “passionate” about the subject and a “gifted” communicator of the material. Students commended him for being able to communicate a vast amount of subject matter and still “make [students] feel that [they] are getting the details” and make it “comprehensible to the students.” Professor Safley’s lectures were described as “organized” and “well thought out.” It was clear to students that he cared about and enjoyed teaching them, and he was described as “approachable.” One student noted that it was frustrating that Professor Safley was not personally responsible for any of the grading, so it was difficult to approach him with questions about how to improve one’s grade in the course.&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;Students’ chief complaint about this course was the excessive amount of assigned weekly reading, with students often expected to read an entire book over the course of one week. Students often felt like they had to “cram” complex books, which they felt led to mere “scratch-the-surface” recitation discussions afterwards and made it difficult to retain the books’ content. One student mentioned that tests asked students to “regurgitate facts instead of analyzing events” and a couple of students reported that grading seemed “arbitrary.” Participation in class is factored into students’ grades, and a student who does not participate receives the same grade as a student who is absent. This course fulfills the History & Tradition sector requirement.",21839-001-612-THOMAS-M--SAFLEY,THOMAS M.,612-THOMAS-M--SAFLEY,SAFLEY,THOMAS M.

"This course explores the major themes, milestones, and debates in the history of the global community since 1750. Using examples from around the world, the course examines such issues as the causes of war and revolution; the impact of religion, science and technology on human communities; the development of global systems of slavery, colonialism, and labor migration; the growth of empires; the rise of nationalisms; and perceived differences between ""East"" and ""West.”

Overall students enjoyed the “small class environment” and gained a “new perspective” towards history. The readings were “interesting” and the class “engaging.”

Praise for Professor Joeden- Forgey was sweeping. Students found her “enthusiastic” about the material and “friendly” and “approachable” in that she “genuinely cared” about the students’ well being. Students remarked that Professor Joeden- Forgey was “fair” and generous with extra-credit. Her knowledge was “extensive” and her insight, “refreshing.”

Students “highly” recommended both this course and its professor to both majors and non-majors alike. Based on fewer than 8 comments.

"This course surveys the dramatic story of transformation from feudal to modern Japan. It has two principal aims: 1) to provide a general narrative of events from 1600 to the present. 2) to introduce students to the most powerful tool of historical analysis: an awareness of the importance of interpretation. Readings include primary and secondary source materials. Students are asked to identify important people and events, and to identify and contemplate different perspectives on the past and present.

Students thoroughly enjoyed HIST 91. The course was applauded for “challenging [students] to think beyond the usual assumptions of history.” Overall, students felt that the course greatly “facilitated understanding of Japanese history.” This “awesome” course was elevated primarily by Professor Dickinson’s lectures, though students appreciated the primary source reading selections that were not based solely on the textbook. As students felt that the main text was “not particularly well-written,” the material was made “far less dry” by the inclusion of these primary source materials. 

Professor Dickinson received high praise for his passion for the subject of Japanese history. “Without his true enthusiasm on the topic,” one student wrote, “I would not have enjoyed the class so much.” Students felt that Professor Dickinson presented the material in “a very interesting and enjoyable manner,” and that his “animated style infused the lectures with an energy that is all too often lacking in history course.” 

The workload was considered very manageable. Readings came from six different texts. Grades were based on four components: class participation (which included blog posts and class reports), two “thought essays,” a mid-term exam and a take-home final exam. There are no prerequisites to the course.

This review is based on the 5 student comments that were submitted.

"&#8232;From an empire to a republic, from a communism to socialist-style capitalism, few countries have ever witnessed so much change in a hundred year period as China during the twentieth century. This course offers an overview of the upheavals that China has experienced from the late Qing to the Post-Mao era, interspersed with what China has experienced from the late Qing to the Post-Mao era, interspersed with personal perspectives revealed in primary source readings such as memoirs, novels, and oral accounts. This class starts with an analysis of the painful transition from the last empire, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), to a modern nation state, followed by exploration of a century-long tale of incessant reform and revolution. The survey will focus on three main themes: 1) the repositioning of China in the new East Asian and world orders; 2) the emergence of a modern Chinese state and nationalistic identity shaped and reshaped by a series of cultural crises; and finally 3) the development and transformation of Chinese modernity. &#8232;&#8232;The feedback that students gave about this class was very mixed.

"The goal of this course will not be to judge or to argue the merits and demerits of our authors (you always can choose to do that voluntarily on your own, apart from our seminar), but to understand how the world looks to different minds. The focus of our discussion will be analytic and comparative. We'll be interested in what views an author holds of human nature and possibility, of society, of motivation, of ethics, of history, and so on. ""Classical Liberal Thought"" is, in briefest form, a belief in minimal government and maximal individual rights and choice, consistent with peace and order. The function of our discussion will be to analyze individual thinkers, and, as we read past our first, to compare our thinkers, looking both for agreements and, above all, disagreements. &#8232;&#8232;Students thoroughly enjoyed this course. They described the class as “exciting” and “excellent”. One student in particular described the course as a “wonderful, educational, experience”.

"&#8232;This seminar examines the economic, demographic, and spatial transformations of American cities since World War II. Topics for analysis include the impact of deindustrialization and the emergence of an information-service economy, internal migration and immigration, ghetto creation, the origin and history of suburbs, and levers of change—politics, policy, social movements, and social reform. Assignments include reading approximately one book per week, short commentary papers, discussion leadership, and a final essay.&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;Readings for this course covered “a great deal of material,” and students reported learning a lot from the books chosen, though not necessarily from the class discussions or lectures themselves.

Furthermore, students found him exceptionally receptive and approachable. Students described Professor Katz as “extremely friendly” and “willing to work with the student” and noted that he “genuinely cares about his students and his subject.” The course structure is very student-driven, with “very little to no lecturing done by the professor.” The majority of classes are comprised of student presentations followed by student-dominated group discussions.

All students who are not Benjamin Franklin Scholars require permission from the instructor to enroll in this course.

"The seminar looks at the evolution of modern Italy from the Napoleonic Era through the unification of the Kingdom in 1861, through its crisis in the First World War and the subsequent struggle for control of the new mass society. It looks at the emergence of the first fascist regime and the first modern dictatorship under Benito Mussolini; the rise and consolidation of that dictatorship, its descent into anti-semitism, defeat in war and the civil war of 1943-45, which followed that defeat. Out of that crisis a new prosperous republic has grown. It traces that story to the latest stage, the curious media dictatorship of Silvio Berlusconi. Italian history contains in its history all the problems of modern Europe and some unique to it. Its culture through the pizza, the pasta and the fine consumer products has become world-wide, and its children live in large numbers in every major city in the world.&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;The course was considered highly interesting by many students, though taught in a way that differed from most history classes. Students noted that the material was not as focused on Italy as the course title would suggest, but rather Italy in the context of the other world. The course also did not focus just on chronological events, but about “theoretical models about what was happening”. &#8232;&#8232;&#8232;Professor Steinberg was commended for “[focusing] on teaching the material, rather than giving grades”. He is “extremely knowledgeable and often does a very good job of encouraging students to participate in discussion.”&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;This review was based on 8 or less student comments.",21870-001-625-JONATHAN-STEINBERG,JONATHAN,625-JONATHAN-STEINBERG,STEINBERG,JONATHAN STEINBERG,/instructor/625-JONATHAN-STEINBERG,26,27,/courses/21870/sections/1/reviews/625-JONATHAN-STEINBERG,3.09,3.14,3.04,2.55,3.55,3.69,2.41,3.45,2.82,3.18,,1.91,"['HIST-318-001', 'ITAL-300-001']",21870-001,ITALY:NAPOLEON-BERLUSCON,/courses/21870/sections/1,HIST-318-001,001,2011A

"This course examines the history, politics, and significance of foreign aid to Africa from the late 19th century to the present. This course explores how foreign aid in the colonial era introduced ideas and institutions that inform modern policies and practices. Students will examine the objectives and intentions of foreign aid while also surveying the topics of developmental theory, African economics, and international aid organizations. &#8232;&#8232;Students appreciated the course material and assured that it was both fascinating and manageable.

"This survey course examines the outbreak, conduct, and aftermath of the First World War. The First World War put an end to the world of the nineteenth century and laid the foundations of the twentieth century, the age of destruction and devastation. This course examines the war in three components: the long-term and immediate causes of the First World War; the war's catastrophic conduct, on the battlefield and on the home front; and, the war's devastating aftermath. While  military operations and certain battles will be discussed, this course is not a military history of the war; it covers the social, economic, political and diplomatic aspects that contributed to the war's outbreak and made possible its execution over four devastating years. No preliminary knowledge or coursework is required.

Students agreed that this course was “excellent” and one of the “best courses” at Penn.  Many commented that classes were well organized, and they learned far more than they had initially expected. Most students noted that they appreciated the “complete perspective” of the course, examining the war from a variety of angles. 

Students praised Professor Holquist for his teaching style and approach to History. One student, summing up the overall student consensus, stated, “Professor Holquist is an excellent lecturer, and his energetic style helps keep students engaged in a very complicated and occasionally confusing subject.”  Multiple respondents declared Professor Holquist to be the best professor they have had at Penn. Students also praised Professor Holquist for his ability to give constructive feedback on assignments. Many appreciated his efforts to be accessible before exams and assignments.

Most found the readings to be quite long, but others commented that all of the assignments were interesting and relevant to understanding the course. Students generally felt this course challenged them, but stated that Professor Holquist was invested in their success and more than willing to help. Both Majors and non-majors highly recommended this course.

To answer this question, this course explores the rise of a distinct political culture, beginning in medieval Muscovy, to its transformation under the impact of a prolonged encounter with European civilization, and the various attempts to re-form Russia from above and below prior to the Revolution of 1917. Main themes include the facade vs. the reality of central authority, the intersection of foreign and domestic issues, the development of a radical intelligentsia, and the tension between empire and nation. 

&#8232;Students thought that this class was very enjoyable. They found the assigned readings, although plentiful, to be interesting. Students especially liked the literary pieces by authors like Tolstoy, Chekhov, and Dostoevsky that were included. Students felt that they learned a lot from this class and several students even claimed that it was one of the best courses that they have taken at Penn. &#8232;

Students found Professor Holquist to be “enthusiastic,” “passionate,” and “talented.” Several students even called Professor Holquist “one of the best professors” that they have had at Penn. Students also praised Professor Holquist for being “knowledgeable and genuinely interested” and “effective.” Students enjoyed his integration of Russian artistic and literary works, and one student commented, “the professor's incorporation of literature and culture beyond just historical events made this class one of the most well rounded and extensive history course I have ever taken.” Another student praised that Professor Holquist, “lectures tell a story of Russian government, culture, industry, war, etc... in a truly artistic and impressive manner.” As far as teaching style, one student expressed, “Professor Holquist slides were never exhausting, which kept me interested and on my toes to pay attention in order not to miss anything important.” Although he refused to give out his slides, Professor Holquist “provided an outline before each lecture, which helped facilitate note taking.” According to the students, Professor Holquist was very accessible. One student wrote, “I have to credit him for always being available to talk, either after class or during office hours. If there was ever a time I was unsure of anything, no matter how trivial, I knew I could ask him without being patronized.” Another student praised Professor Holquist for “a concerted effort to get every member of the class to participate, which lends the course a comfortable, seminar aura.” The students admired Professor Holquist’s dedication to feedback. One student mentioned the fact that Professor Holquist takes the time to make well-thought comments on every student’s paper. &#8232;&#8232;This course has no prerequisites and is open to Freshmen and Upperclassmen. Several students noted that the workload, especially the amount of reading material, is a bit challenging. One student estimated, “about 60 pages per lecture,” and then explained that Professor Holquist randomly selects students to answer these questions as a part of the 20% participation grade. Students praised Professor Holquist for his fairness in grading. In a particular, a student wrote “Prof. Holquist has reasonably high expectations for the memorization, understanding, and synthesis of course material but recognizes the difficulty of memorizing the majority of the material.” The course fulfills the History & Tradition requirement. The course is highly recommended to majors and non-majors.

"The subject of this course is the history of the British Isles from the Roman Conquest in 43AD to the creation of the United Kingdom in 1707. Between these two dates the various societies and cultures in the British Isles were brought into the orbit of the Roman Empire, converted to Latin Christianity, and developed distinctive cultures and strong ties with the Continent. From the twelfth century on, the kingdom of England began to exert its power over Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, although English power waxed and waned in these areas between the twelfth and the seventeenth centuries. The Anglo-Norman continental empire of the Plantagenet dynasty also played a large part in shaping the English monarchy, as did the playing out of the Hundred Years War, the internal divisions in fifteenth-century English society, and the rise of the Tudor-Stuart dynasty. &#8232;

Students overall enjoyed this course. Students found the course material and readings to be “interesting.” Students enjoyed lectures, but found the coursework to be difficult. Students struggled with the fact that the lecture PowerPoint presentations were not available online, so they had no way to cross-reference their notes. 

They praised Professor Todd for being “enthusiastic” about the subject. However, students did have trouble following her fast pace. One student wrote that Professor Todd is “a good lecturer, but speeds along at times.” Students were “impressed” by Professor Todd, but they felt that her expectations on tests and exams were difficult to live up to.&#8232;&#8232;

This course has no prerequisites and is open to Freshmen and Upperclassmen. Students were emphatic in mentioning that the course is “challenging.” Students reported having difficulty with preparing for exams and essays. One student wrote, I felt that the material being taught in class and assigned to us in readings was not the same as the material we were being tested on,” in class. Students do recommend the course on the basis of its interesting course material, however, students warn, “the workload and expectations were closer to those required for a 400 level course than an 050.” This course does not fulfill any of the General Requirements.

"This course covers the development of Latin America from pre-Columbian times to 1850. Emphasis is on the interaction between European, Indian, and African elements in colonial society, the growth of national consciousness, and the related phenomena of political instability and economic underdevelopment. &#8232;

Students found the seminar-like format of the course unsuitable for a 75-person lecture. Discussions were hard in the class, and students would have preferred more of a lecture-based course. But overall, students commented that the material covered in class was interesting. They also appreciated the fact that the class, although more of a survey course, addressed topics in more depth.&#8232;

Students agreed that Professor Walker was very ""knowledgeable about the subject matter"" and that ""her passion for the subject was apparent in class,"" making the course ""a more enriching experience."" However, due to the unfortunate class structure, she was ""not as engaging as she could have been.""&#8232;&#8232;

This course fulfills the History and Tradition general requirement. Although there are many readings assigned, the course grade depends mostly on the essays and final assignments. Students recommended this course to anyone looking to fulfill a history requirement and to history majors.

"The class covers the major themes, events, and personalities in African history from the early nineteenth century through the 1960's. The class material include the abolition of slave trade, European Imperialism, impact of colonial rule, African resistance, religious and cultural movements, rise of nationalism and pan-Africanism, issues of ethnicity and ""tribalism"" in modern Africa.&#8232;

&#8232;All students agreed that the class was “wonderful” and “interesting.” However, some felt that the course covered too much information for one semester. They expressed that some of the material was “too broad both chronologically and geographically” and that it relied excessively on the readings. Students said that the readings were interesting and that the material was engaging even to those who know little about History and Africa. Overall, the class “piqued interest to learn more.”&#8232;&#8232;

Students raved about the “passionate and knowledgeable” Professor Cassanelli. Even though some expressed that he was a little disorganized in lectures and starts and ended class late, he genuinely cared about the material and the students. One student said that, “Professor Cassanelli is an incredible lecturer who is truly fascinated by the material and completely engaged in teaching it.” Students praised Professor Cassanelli for providing extra help to insure that the students developed a better understanding of the material.&#8232;&#8232;

Generally, students felt that the work requirements were fine. Some students expressed that the readings, although interesting and informative, were “excessive” and that the journals were “tedious.” This course fulfills the History and Tradition sector requirement.

"This course is a survey of the modern Middle East with special emphasis on the experiences of ordinary men and women as articulated in biographies, novels, and regional case studies. Issues covered include the collapse of empires and the rise of a new state system following WWI, and the roots and consequences of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the Iranian revolution and the U.S.-Iraq War. Themes include: the colonial encounter with Europe and the emergence of nationalist movements, the relationship between state and society, economic development and international relations, and religion and cultural identity.&#8232;&#8232;

Overall, students found this course to be interesting. However, a student did mentioned that the course was “extremely broad,” and a couple mentioned that they thought there was too much emphasis placed on the Ottoman Empire. &#8232;&#8232;

Most of the students in this course found Professor Trout-Powell to be enthusiastic and a great lecturer. However, there were also a few students who said Professor Trout-Powell was a poor lecturer, and that taking notes could be difficult because of the amount of information given during lecture. Students found Professor Trout-Powell’s accessibility to be inconsistent. A couple of students also commented that Professor Trout-Powell “truly cares about her students,” and is available during office hours, while another student commented that Professor Trout-Powell was “often unavailable, [did] not respond to email, and cancel[ed] her office hours.” &#8232;

Most of the students who commented on this course said that the reading load was very heavy, and could therefore easily “get overwhelming.” One student also said that many of the assigned readings did not seem to have value. Another student also mentioned that the exams and papers were “pretty hard,” while another stated that as a “non major [they] found it very challenging.” This course fulfills the History & Tradition Sector.

"This course concentrates on the economy of Europe in the Early Modern Period, 1450-1750, in which Europe developed from an agriculturally-based economy to an industrially-based economy, with attendant changes in society and culture. From a subsistence-level productivity, the European economy expanded to create great surfeits of good, with attendant changes in consumption and expectation. Europe grew from a regional economic system to become part—some would say the heart—of a global economy, with attendant changes in worldview and identity. 

Most students felt that although the course material was interesting, the course needed restructuring, as there was too much content that made lectures seem frantic and abstract. 

Students found Professor Safley to be “one of the best lecturers” they have had, feeling that he knew how to engage and motivate students. Students thought that Professor Safley was willing to answer questions during and outside of class, although his lectures did not always integrate with the readings and could be disorganized.

Students found it difficult to master so much material and that the class required a lot of work.

"American Jewish Experience offers a comprehensive survey of American Jewish history from the colonial period to the present. It covers the different waves of Jewish immigration to the United States and examines the construction of Jewish political, cultural, and religious life in America. Topics include American Judaism, the Jewish labor movement, Jewish politics and popular culture, and the responses of American Jews to the Holocaust and the State of Israel. &#8232;&#8232;

Students universally consider this an “excellent course.” They found the material “interesting [and] engaging,” and mentioned that the “visual material really contributes to the learning process of the class.” Overall, it appears students share the opinion that “the course is a great class: very interesting.” &#8232;&#8232;

In this class, Professor Wenger demonstrated obvious “knowledge and [his] ability to communicate the material was great.” Other students confirmed that, “Professor Wenger is a strong lecturer who presented a cohesive picture of American Jewish History over the last several hundred years.” However, one student commented that, “whenever asked a question in class, Professor Wenger always said we would come to it later.” Students appreciate that she was “a very good lecturer” and felt it was clear she was “focused…and passionate about the material.” Students said that it was “easy to take notes and follow along” throughout the semester.&#8232;&#8232;

American Jewish Experience includes a “good amount of assignments,” but “assigned readings are of excellent value.” While some students suggested “including some more literary readings,” others observed that, “many people did not do the readings before class, because we covered most of the material the following day in class.” Some students warned that future attendees should “be prepared for a lot of reading.” This course contributes to the Jewish History Concentration, and is an introductory level history course

"This course surveys the development of law in the United States until the year 1877. The emphasis is on the interaction between law and social forces. The course covers such subjects as the evolution of the legal profession, the transformation of English law during the American Revolution, the making and implementation of the Constitution, and issues concerning business and economic development, the law of slavery, the status of women, and civil liberties. &#8232;&#8232;

Many students felt that the topic of American law was not for everyone, but that it provided an excellent framework for analyzing legal developments in America. They felt that Professor Berry's style of teaching kept the class exciting and engaging, and kept students “on the ball.” &#8232;

While students thought that the course and Professor Berry were difficult, they thought that her use of the Socratic Method of lecturing, with cold-calling, was difficult but very rewarding. One student said that, “it was an honor sitting in the same room as someone who is not only teaching American law, but also helping to shape it.” While some students thought Professor Berry was very difficult, others appreciated the way that she forced them to think critically. Most students agree that Professor Berry made herself available for questions and concerns. 

&#8232;Some students complained that the book reviews that Professor Berry assigned did not seem relevant to the course. Many students commented on the difficulty of the course, though they generally thought that papers and exams were graded leniently. Students also thought that discipline is required in such a course because there is a lot of individual reading and analysis.

"This course focuses on Southern culture and history from 1607-1860, from Jamestown to secession. It traces the rise of slavery and plantation society, the growth of Southern sectionalism and its explosion into Civil War. A midterm, short paper (5-7 pages) and final are required.&#8232;&#8232;

Students really enjoyed the material of the course, describing it as “well-rounded.” Some students felt that the class emphasized the subject of slavery too much, and others felt that the quality of the material decreased as the course progressed. Other students felt upset about the “political bias” they perceived in the class. However, several students described the class as “the best class I have ever taken at Penn.”&#8232;&#8232;

Students really enjoyed Professor McCurry, calling her “extremely knowledgeable,” “very accessible,” and a “great lecturer.” Some students criticized her PowerPoint slides but enjoyed her “lucid and stimulating…arguments.” One student commended Professor McCurry’s ability to “make history come alive in her exciting lectures” and recommended that, “everyone should take a course with Professor McCurry before leaving Penn.” Other students described her as “amazing” and “magnificent” and applauded her knowledge of and passion for the subject matter, mentioning, “she is the most respected historian on this topic.”&#8232;

Some students felt that the workload was too heavy for an introductory course, such as long reading assignments. Students also emphasized the fact that this course does require a certain amount of effort—it is “a lot of work” and is not “an easy A.” Other students expressed anger about what they perceived as an “A’s only for brilliance policy,” especially for an intro course. Students also emphasized that excellent critical writing was essential to succeed in this course.

"This course surveys the history of relations among the great powers in East Asia from 1600 to the present. Special emphasis is played upon the peculiarities of cross-national exchange in Asia (as compared to Europe), particularly the difficulties of relations among states possessing fundamentally different cultural traditions. The course explores the many informal, as well as formal, means of diplomacy in Asia over the past 400 years. &#8232;&#8232;

Overall students enjoyed this course. Students did feel that the breadth of the material made exams challenging, but nonetheless, the students found the material to be “interesting.” Several students did warn that the course is a “basic survey,” and therefore it “glosses over” a lot of information. &#8232;&#8232;

Students praised Professor Dickinson for his “enthusiasm.” One student wrote, “he always brings a fresh perspective on history.” Students praised Professor Dickinson for incorporating multimedia, such as video clips, into his presentations. However, some students did note that Professor Dickinson has a tendency to spend extra time on video clips and other “housekeeping matters at the beginning of class and not get through all the material the lecture was meant to cover.” Although most students found Professor Dickinson to be engaging, some mentioned that he had a tendency to read off of his slides. Students also noted that Professor Dickinson is very, “accessible and offers interesting insights on the subject matter.”&#8232;&#8232;

Students found this course to be “challenging” and “interesting.” Students overall believed that the assignments were fair. Several students did recommend the course to other students interested in the area because it provides a great “basic overview” on the topic.

"The Greeks enjoy a special place in the construction of western culture and identity, and yet many of us have only the vaguest notion of what their culture was like. A few Greek myths at bedtime when we are kids, maybe a Greek tragedy like Sophocles' Oedipus when we are at school: these are often the only contact we have with the world of the ancient Mediterranean. The story of the Greeks, however, deserves a wider audience, because so much of what we esteem in our own culture derives from them: democracy, epic poetry, lyric poetry, tragedy, history writing, philosophy, aesthetic taste, all of these and many other features of cultural life enter the West from Greece. The oracle of Apollo at Delphi had inscribed over the temple, ""Know Thyself."" For this course, that also means knowing the Greeks. The course will cover the period from the Late Bronze Age, c. 1500 BC, down to the time of Philip of Macedon, c. 350 BC, concentrating on the two hundred year interval from 600-400 BC.

Most of the students who took this course commented that it was very interesting and engaging. One student also commented that this was a “great class,” and another that is was “highly enjoyable.” One student also said that the course was entertaining. 

The majority of the students who commented on the course found Professor McInerney to be knowledgeable and a great lecturer. A couple of students also mentioned that Professor McInerney was an “out-standing teacher” and an “entertaining lecturer.” One student also described Professor McInerney was “enthusiastic and easy to follow,” while another said he was “both intelligent and inspiring.”

A couple of students mentioned that there was heavy workload. One commented that “the readings are long and extensive,” while another said that there was “good amount of busy work too.” Several students also mentioned that the grading was difficult, and a few students added that the open-ended paper and the midterm were difficult. One student commented that the power points were “not very helpful and sometimes contain outdated information,” though another said that they found the posting of outlines on Blackboard to be helpful. Students were divided on the appropriateness of the material for an introductory course. A couple of students felt that they would recommend this as an introductory course, while several said that the course was too hard for an introductory class, with one student commenting that the course “assumes prior subject matter knowledge, and makes no effort to help out.”

"What do you know about Berlin's history, architecture, culture, and political life? The present course will offer a survey of the history of Prussia, beginning with the seventeenth century, and the unification of the small towns of Berlin and koelln to establish a new capital for this country. It will tell the story of Berlin's rising political prominence in the eighteenth century, its transformation into an industrial city in the late nineteenth century, its rise to metropolis in the early twentieth century, its history during the Third Reich, and the post-war cold war period. The course will conclude its historical survey with a consideration of Berlin's position as a capital in reunified Germany. The historical survey will be supplemented by a study of Berlin's urban structure, its significant architecture from the eighteenth century (i.e. Schinkel) to the nineteenth (new worker's housing, garden suburbs) and twentieth centuries (Bauhaus, Speer designs, postwar rebuilding, GDR housing projects, post-unification building boom). In addition, students read literary texts about the city, and consider the visual art and music created in and about Berlin. Indeed, Berlin will be a specific example to explore German history and cultural life of the last 300 years. The course is interdisciplinary with the fields of German Studies, history, history of art, and urban studies. It is also designed as a preparation for undergraduate students who are considering spending a junior semester with the Penn Abroad Program in Berlin.&#8232;&#8232;

"&#8232;This course surveys the history of medical knowledge and practice from antiquity to the present. The course takes a broadly chronological approach, blending the perspectives of the patient, the physician, and society as a whole--recognizing that medicine has always aspired to ""treat"" healthy people as well as the sick. Rather than history ""from the “top down"" or ""from the “bottom up,” this course sets its sights on history from the inside out. This means, first, that medical knowledge and practice is understood through the personal experiences of patients and caregivers. Required readings consist largely of primary sources, from elite medical texts to patient diaries. Short research assignments encourage students to adopt the perspectives of a range of actors in various historical eras. &#8232;&#8232;
Students raved about the course. They thought that the lectures were interesting and that the course “really took advantage of Philadelphia’s rich medical history,” and that the interesting readings complemented the lectures. Students reported that they enjoyed the creative assignments and the course as a whole.

 &#8232;&#8232;Students praised Professor Barnes as well. They thought that Professor Barnes was enthusiastic and passionate about the course and flexible with regard to assignments and due dates. One student commented that Professor Barnes is the “best professor at Penn.” &#8232;&#8232;

Students generally agreed that the course required a lot of work. They claimed that Professor Barnes fairly warns students from day one of the amount of work that the course will require. The course’s assignments include two extensive research papers, a shorter paper, two midterms, a final, and weekly assignments.

"This course focuses on health and healing in the colonial and post-colonial world. The course gives special attention to local healing under condition of domination, to definitions of the body and the person in biomedicine and in non-European healing traditions, and to the political and cultural place of medicine in regions which have experienced colonial rule.&#8232;&#8232;

Students agreed that the course was extremely interesting and enlightening. However, the course was packed with information, and some students found the amount they learned to be ""quite overwhelming.""

Despite this, students agreed that they learned a lot from the course.

Students found Professor Petrie to be extremely engaging during his lectures. He was ""approachable and willing to meet students outside of class to discuss anything."" Students felt he was able to cover a wide range of topics.

"This course will explore the representations of the West in eighteenth- and nineteenth- century Russian literature and philosophy. Students will consider the Russian visions of various events and aspects of Western political and social life Revolutions, educational system, public executions, resorts, etc. within the context of Russian intellectual history. Students will also examine how images of the West reflect Russia's own cultural concerns, anticipations, and biases, as well as aesthetic preoccupations and interests of Russian writers. The discussion will include literary works by Karamzin, Pushkin, Gogol, Dostoevsky, Leskov, and Tolstoy, as well as non-fictional documents, such as travelers' letters, diaries, and historiosophical treatises of Russian Freemasons, Romantic and Positivist thinkers, and Russian social philosophers of the late nineteenth century. A basic knowledge of nineteenth-century European history is desirable. The class consists of lectures, discussion, short writing assignments, and two in-class tests.

"This course surveys the major political, economic, social and intellectual trends in the making of modern Japan. Special emphasis is given to the turbulent relationship between state and society from 1800 to the present. 

Many of the students in Modern Japanese History found the course to be engaging and “truly interesting,” but a few said that it was “painfully boring;” a remark that seemed to stem from disagreement with the professor's method of teaching. Students generally considered the readings “fine” and liked the fact that literature is incorporated into the class. However, many of the students did not appreciate that Professor Dickinson “would not really start the lecture until a half-an-hour into the course.” This was because “ 30 minutes of each lecture are used for silly anecdotes and music videos,” which many students did not think “connect[ed] to the material in a meaningful way usually.” 

Students' reactions to Professor Dickinson's teaching methods were wildly different. Some taking the course said that Professor Dickinson is “the most interesting teacher I have had to date,” “hilarious,” and that Professor Dickinson made it “ one of the best courses” that one student ever took. However, almost all students reported that Professor Dickinson has certain unique opinions on Japanese history that color “almost all of his lectures” and that are “not open to debate.” Some found that these interpretations “actually made the class more interesting,” but others thought his take on Japan “borders on revisionist history” and was “very often not entirely corroborated by the readings assigned.” Many of those who did disagree with his teaching style still complimented Professor Dickinson for his “wealth of knowledge” and enthusiasm.

"This course offered an overview of the upheavals that “Greater China” has experienced from the late Qing to the Post-Mao era, interspersed with personal perspectives revealed in primary source readings such as memoirs, novels, and oral accounts. The survey course focused on three main themes: 1) the repositioning of China in the new East Asian and world orders; 2) the emergence of a modern Chinese state and nationalistic identity shaped and reshaped by a series of cultural crises; and finally, 3) the development and transformation of Chinese modernity. 

Students were for the most part very pleased with HIST097401. They frequently described it as “interesting” and “engaging,” and said the course gave them a new understanding of Chinese culture. The readings were held in high acclaim, especially Spence's The Search for Modern China, and several students felt that they learned more from the readings than from lectures.

While Professor Fei's lectures were “a joy to attend,” a common complaint was that at times her accent made her hard to understand. The lectures were often “disorganized” and occasionally felt like a “repeat of the material” that was covered in readings, but “enjoyable” nevertheless. Professor Fei “addresses the student's needs very well” and “is willing to meet with students whenever.”

There are no prerequisites for HIST097, and aside from the occasional frustration, there were no complaints about the course-load, though one student called the assigned reading “realistically...impossible to do all the time.” As a warning, sometimes the class stretches past 50 minutes, but students highly recommend the course to both majors and non-majors. The course fulfills the History and Tradition Sector.

"The course traces the economic, social, and political history of American cities after World War II. It focuses on how the economic problems of the industrial city were compounded by the racial conflicts of the 1950s and 1960s and the fiscal crises of the 1970s. The last part of the course examines the forces that led to the revitalization of cities in recent years.

Students commented that while the subject matter was very interesting, “the logistics of the class hindered it.” Many students thought the class would have been taught better in a small seminar setting instead of a big lecture in a room that “Was too large to have discussions.” 

Students’ feelings for Professor Katz was mixed: while some students described him as “very knowledgeable and passionate about the topic,” some students thought he was “not very involved in the course.” Students sometimes found him “mumbling and going off on irrelevant tangents.” Due to these reasons, some students felt disconnected from the professor and the course. Students commented that Professor Katz “would be better in a small seminar setting.”

According to students, the course readings were well-thought out and they complemented each other well. However, some students stated that keeping up with the reading “took more effort than expected.” This course was highly recommended to non-majors who are interested in the history of cities, because a lot of students found the class to be a “great introduction to urban studies,” and became interested in the major.",26190-401-657-MICHAEL-B-KATZ,MICHAEL B,657-MICHAEL-B-KATZ,KATZ,MICHAEL B KATZ,/instructor/657-MICHAEL-B-KATZ,39,41,/courses/26190/sections/401/reviews/657-MICHAEL-B-KATZ,2.44,2.31,2.19,2.66,2.06,2.16,2.72,2.81,2.03,1.47,,2.59,"['HIST-153-401', 'URBS-104-401']",26190-401,URBAN CRISIS,/courses/26190/sections/401,HIST-153-401,401,2010A

"This course covered the history of the American South from the end of the Civil War to the present, focusing on politics, economics, popular culture, and race and gender relations. 

Most students felt that this was one of the best classes at Penn and appreciated the insightful, interesting lectures. Although some commented that class could be “a bit dry or tedious at times,” the general consensus was that this was a “very impressive course” that illuminated the history of the South.

Students declared that Professor Hackney “made history come alive” and that he was an excellent teacher with the ability to “stimulate the lecture hall with his knowledge and personal involvement.” Many explained that he will be greatly missed in the history department following his retirement. 

This class is recommended for both majors and non-majors. Students reported learning a great deal about the American South and most did not feel that there was a heavy workload.",26196-001-653-FRANCIS-SHELDON-HACKNEY,FRANCIS SHELDON,653-FRANCIS-SHELDON-HACKNEY,HACKNEY,FRANCIS SHELDON HACKNEY,/instructor/653-FRANCIS-SHELDON-HACKNEY,140,152,/courses/26196/sections/1/reviews/653-FRANCIS-SHELDON-HACKNEY,2.75,3.09,3.05,2.06,2.90,3.23,2.65,3.49,3.10,2.98,,2.10,['HIST-171-001'],26196-001,AMERICAN SOUTH 1861-PRES,/courses/26196/sections/1,HIST-171-001,001,2010A

"This course focuses on the history of sexuality in the U.S. It explores the past to consider why sexuality has been so central to American identities, culture, and politics. Primary documents and other readings focus on the history of sexual ideology and regulation; popular culture and changing sexual practices; the emergence of distinct sexual identities and communities; the politics of sexuality; and the relationship between sexual and other forms of social difference, such as gender, race, ethnicity, age, and class. The topic covered are relevant to current political debate, among them: sexual representation and censorship, sexual violence, adolescent sexuality, the politics of reproduction, gay and lesbian sexualities and sexually transmitted diseases. The literature to be read in this course includes: Kathy Peiss, Major Problems in the History of American Sexuality; Harriet Jacobs, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl; Andrew Tone, Devices & Desires: A History of Contraceptives in America; Gay New York: Gender, George Chauncey Urban Culture and the Making of the Gay Male World, 1890-1940; Janice Irvine, Talk About Sex. The critical assessments for this course include two essays, each worth 20% of the final grade, a primary document paper worth 35% and a take-home exam in an essay question format worth 25%. 

There were mixed reviews over this course, however many students thought the “content is very interesting” but thought the “class discussions seemed dull” and the material “could have been conveyed in a more interesting way.” Some students did really enjoy the class and thought the use of film and popular culture was fascinating. Overall, the students enjoyed the class but were not satisfied with class discussions, yet they agreed that they were “provided with a new understanding of sexuality.”

The students agree that Professor Peiss “is a great teacher” and was “glad to answer questions” and was “extremely accessible.” They thought Professor Peiss was “very passionate about the subject” but thought she should “make the lecture time more interactive” and engaging.

Students commented that “there is a fair amount of work,” even considered a “ridiculous” amount by a few, but the assignments were “engaging” and “original.” The “entire course grade is based on four papers,” said one student.

"This course examines the political, cultural, and intellectual history of America between 1954 and 1974. It considers the civil rights movement, the New Frontier and Great Society, the Supreme Court and right politics, the rise of the New Right, the debate over Vietnam, student radicalism, sexual liberation movements, black power, the counterculture, the urban crisis, and white backlash. The course emphasizes the transformation of liberalism and the revitalization of conservatism, and the tensions between integration and separatism, between libertarianism and communitarianism that shaped the social movements of the sixties. 

This course did not receive one negative review, and many even commented it was “one of the best history courses” they've taken at Penn. Students agree that “lectures are fun and informative” and that they “enjoy going to class.” The lectures are “stimulating, funny, intriguing and his stories are extremely well-told.” Everyone claims to have “learned so much in every class.”

Professor Sugrue is “incredibly competent” and “enthusiastic.” Students agree that he was “an incredible lecturer” and an “excellent professor.” He was “receptive to questions and concerns” and “open-minded as to the subject material choice for the research paper.” He was “passionate” and “engaging.”

One student comments on the final assessments, saying it “would have been nice to only have a final paper or only a final exam” while another comments that “the expectation of wider reading for the midterm was not communicated.” A history major notes that the class was “not to his personal tastes” because the “material was not always linked,” while a nursing student comments “that she was not looking forward to the history sector, but this class has been terrific.”",26215-001-2779-THOMAS-J--SUGRUE,THOMAS J.,2779-THOMAS-J--SUGRUE,SUGRUE,THOMAS J.

"This course examines the international politics of 20th Century Europe. It will cover the period in which Europe lots its dominant international position and was forced to adjust to its new place in world politics while struggling with violence in the forms of wars, genocide, and other conflicts. Specil emphasis will be placed on the decline and subsequent partial recovery of Europe’s international position, especially the contrasted between international competition and transnational cooperation within Europe, the impact of the two World Wars, the ambivalent legacy of the Cold War, and Europe’s role in the post-Cold War world. 

Many students enjoyed this class and described it as “awesome” and “great” and explained that it offered a great way of looking at this specific period in Europe was a whole. Others commented that “the overall set up of the course was great,” and found that they “learned a lot of valuable information"" and ""perspective in the topic.” 

Students feedback was overwhelmingly positive for Professor McDougall. Students called him a “tremendous lecturer” and “one of the best lecturers… ever.” Another student explained that McDougall “does a great job of communicating the subject matter.” Every student enjoyed his lectures and found him “amazingly engaging.” Many students commented that McDougall was a “favorite teacher and the best lecturer.” Students also felt that McDougall “cares about his students.” One critique of McDougall was that he took a while to grade, and another student suggested that McDougall’s lecturing pace may be a little fast, and that it can be difficult to set up meetings with the professor. Other critiques on teaching were mainly directed towards the TA, as many students found it difficult to contact the TA and also felt that perhaps one TA was not enough. 

The most common critique of this course focused on the assignments; namely, students found it difficult to determine the comparative importance of each assignment, and also difficult to determine expectations. Many students found that grades reflected “nit picky grammar and not enough on the actual content.” Also, some found it very difficult to calculate a final grade from the course and reported “[going[ into the final exam only knowing 25% of the [final] grade.” One student commented that the course ""is not extremely difficult.” Students felt they were prepared for the final and felt that the readings were reasonable and “sometimes helpful.” Many students recommended this course to all students although it does not fulfill the sector requirement.

"This survey course examines the outbreak, conduct, and aftermath of the First World War. The First World War put an end to the world of the nineteenth century and laid the foundations of the twentieth century, the age of destruction and devastation. The course examines the war in three components: the long-term and immediate causes of the First World War; the war's catastrophic conduct, on the battlefield and on the home front; and, the war's devastating aftermath. While military operations and certain battles are discussed, this course is not a military history of the war; it covers the social, economic, political and diplomatic aspects that contributed to the war's outbreak and made possible its execution over four devastating years. No preliminary knowledge or coursework is required.
	Students unanimously liked this “interesting” class. One student wrote, “This course was fantastic. I couldn’t have asked for anything better. It makes me wish I was a history major.” Students also liked the structure of the course which “analyzed the major players [in the war] separately, then the causes, and then much later in the course, the actual war.” Students said this format “made the countries’ actions make sense.”
	Students raved about Professor Holquist. They called him “the most engaging lecturer I’ve had at Penn,” “passionate,” and said “his enthusiasm for the subject is infectious.” One student wrote, “Professor Holquist was very accessible and accommodating throughout the semester. He is incredibly knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the subject matter.” Another added that Professor Holquist made sure to “answer each question in a thorough and interesting manner.”
This course was recommended for both majors and non-majors. A few students mentioned that there was a lot of required reading that could be “dense” but were sure to add that “the readings were relevant to the course.”

"This course examines the diplomatic origins, military course and domestic implications of World War II. Students have a chance to study World War II in different points of views, analyzing the event in various ways.

Many students mentioned that the course has “a top notch reputation for being the best,” and that “it has met” or “exceeded [their] every expectation.” The lectures, according to students, were truly exciting and gripping, while offering a comprehensive review of the conflict in all its gory detail, from internal politics, to regional controversies to big picture plans and ideology.

One student commented that Professor “Childers defines Penn’s History Department.” Students found his lecture to be funny and engaging, and many agreed that his “ability to stir student interest and to analyze the war from so many different facets [was] what [made] the course spectacular.” He was also “willing to discuss [students’] questions after class, during office hours, or whenever he [was] free.” 

Although this class was recommended for both majors and non-majors, students did state that the amount of reading for the class could be overwhelming sometimes. Some students found the reading to be repetitive from lecture or overly detailed. The workload, according to students, can be overwhelming “especially for non-majors who are not used to copious readings.” Overall, students stated that “to any student interested even vaguely in World War II, this is a great class to take.”",26221-001-655-THOMAS-C-CHILDERS,THOMAS C,655-THOMAS-C-CHILDERS,CHILDERS,THOMAS C CHILDERS,/instructor/655-THOMAS-C-CHILDERS,173,183,/courses/26221/sections/1/reviews/655-THOMAS-C-CHILDERS,3.54,3.88,3.77,2.63,3.09,3.86,3.40,3.85,3.58,3.88,,2.77,['HIST-431-001'],26221-001,A WORLD AT WAR,/courses/26221/sections/1,HIST-431-001,001,2010A

"This course explores the Roman Empire from its creation to its legacies that remain today. The subject matter includes the social, economic, and political structure of the empire. The course will also discuss the conquest, warfare, administration, and law that made the empire possible and the military, cultural, and religious challenges that threatened it. The timeline of the course material stretches from the creation of the Roman Empire to the last three centuries BC. Focus is placed on the political structure of the Roman Empire and its transition from Republic to Principate. This course will also explore the creation of a single Roman culture through its forms of literature (such as satire), entertainment (such as gladiatorial arenas), and other aspects that contributed to the creation of a Roman social order. 

Students found this course very informative. Many summed up the course as “wonderful,” “great course,” or “interesting and fun.” However, the material was very overwhelming to some students as the course covers “500 years of Roman history while still attempting to focus on themes and culture rather than events.” Therefore, many students found the course to contain a great deal of information in a short period of time, and was a “rigorous survey of Ancient Rome” as not as introductory as the course name suggests. 

Professor Grey received mixed reviews from students. Many found the Powerpoint slides to be confusing out of context and also found the professor himself to be confusing at times. However, many students agreed that “Dr. Grey is an outstanding teacher” and cited his “wonderful” lectures and “enthusiasm for the material.” Students were similarly impressed by the Professor’s preparation for class and energy throughout the lecture. Although some commented that the lectures were “not helpful at all,” many students disagreed and found his lectures to be extremely entertaining and engaging, and said that the course was “pretty easy...[and Grey is] funny, comfortable, and a great storyteller.” 

Although many students took this course to fulfill the History and Tradition Sector (and a majority were freshman), many commented that the course should not be directed at non-majors due to the extensive course material and readings. The vast majority of students noted that the readings were quite extensive and the material covered was “too much for an introductory course.” Many students even questioned the importance of the readings because they did not understand their connection to the material presented during lecture. Some students even went so far as to state that the “course required an unrealistic amount of reading, some of which was not entirely necessary to do well in the class [but instead] hinder[ed] students’ ability to focus on subject matter.” However, overall students found Professor Grey’s tests and assignments “fair” and the expectations “reasonable and clearly stated.” Some students were displeased with their grades, as there is no curve. Some also found the “exam grading was a little bit arbitrary.” However, many students found that this course was “a great intro to Roman history.” In addition, students were pleased with what they learned and felt prepared for their exams.",25574-401-2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY,CAMPBELL AINSWORTH,2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY,GREY,CAMPBELL AINSWORTH GREY,/instructor/2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY,140,154,/courses/25574/sections/401/reviews/2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY,2.77,3.18,2.73,2.60,2.69,3.10,2.65,3.52,2.51,2.93,,2.69,"['ANCH-027-401', 'HIST-027-401']",25574-401,ANCIENT ROME,/courses/25574/sections/401,ANCH-027-401,401,2010A

"This course covered twentieth-century Russian cultural and social history. The course was organized around a medium-length film, text or set of texts (novella, play, memoir, set of short stories) which opened up the weekly theme. The final exam involved reading comprehension.

Overall students enjoyed this course and found it interesting. However, one student did comment that the course was “sort of hard when you have no background in Soviet history.”

Students found that Professor Platt was very knowledgeable, passionate, and engaging. A couple of students also mentioned that Professor Platt was “very helpful during office hours and willing to discuss papers.” However, one student did mention that Professor Platt was sometimes unprepared for lectures.

Several students commented that there was a heavy reading load every week.

"This course surveys Latin American and Caribbean history from the Haitian Revolution of 1791 to the present. It is designed to examine the legacy of Spanish colonialism and slavery, movements for national and cultural independence, twentieth-century radicalism, and the politics of race in contemporary Latin America. Readings include fictional as well as analytical representations, and a film series will accompany the course.

All students surveyed reported learning a lot from this course while enjoying the semester. Many students even felt that the course sparked an interest in the subject material. Many students describe the course as “great” and enjoyed how much they learned, which one student described as an “amazing” amount of information. A few students, however, agreed that they would have preferred covering the material at a slower rate so that they could go into more depth on each subject. 

According to student reviews, Professor Farnsworth-Alvear is enthusiastic, energetic, and interesting. Students appreciated how Professor Farnsworth-Alvear made every lecture engaging. “Professor Farnsworth-Alvear’s obvious enthusiasm keeps students engaged in what is already very interesting material,” one student wrote. Another student described her as “fun, brilliant, passionate, and accessible.” One student found Professor Farnsworth-Alvear to be a bit difficult to follow at times, but added that this may just be a result of her enthusiasm about presenting what she knows to the class.

Because all lectures were posted online as audio files, a couple of students felt that the pressure to go to class was very low. A few describe the class as “easy” noting that “[t]here isn’t too much extra work required.” The course allows students to select four essays to write throughout the semester, which students found helpful because they could select essays that fit into their schedules and particular interests. Students would recommend this course regardless of history background; as one student wrote, “With completely no experience taking history classes, I found this class informative, engaging, and accessible.” This course satisfies the History & Tradition Sector and Cross Cultural Analysis requirement.

"From an empire to a republic, from a communism to socialist-style capitalism, few countries have ever witnessed so much change in a hundred year period as China during the twentieth century. How are we to make sense out of this seeming chaos? This course offers an overview of the upheavals that China has experienced from the late Qing to the Post-Mao era, interspersed that China has experienced from the late Qing to the Post-Mao era, interspersed with personal perspectives revealed in primary source readings such as memoirs, novels, and oral accounts. The course starts with an analysis of the painful transition from the last empire, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), to a modern nation state, followed by exploration of a century-long tale of incessant reform and revolution. The survey focuses on three main themes: 1) the repositioning of China in the new East Asian and world orders; 2) the emergence of a modern Chinese state and nationalistic identity shaped and reshaped by a series of cultural crises; and finally, 3) the development and transformation of Chinese modernity.

The majority of students who reviewed this course expressed that they very much enjoyed it and learned a lot from its engaging content. As one student said, the course provided “an excellent view of modern China, in a very objective manner.”  One of the only criticisms of the course was that it covered a very broad spectrum of history, and may have been more enjoyable if it had been able to take a more specific approach to some of the material.  

Several students felt that Professor Fei was friendly, accessible outside of class, and eager to help her students succeed. While students complimented Professor Fei on delivering very animated and funny lectures, many of Professor Fei’s students also mentioned the disorganized nature of these lectures, detracting for some students from the efficacy and clarity of the course. 

One reviewer would recommend this course to anyone interested in the topic, saying, “I think the course is great for anyone who wants an interesting and manageable introductory course to modern Chinese history.” ",27558-401-2997-SI-YEN-FEI,SI-YEN,2997-SI-YEN-FEI,FEI,SI-YEN FEI,/instructor/2997-SI-YEN-FEI,82,99,/courses/27558/sections/401/reviews/2997-SI-YEN-FEI,2.79,2.51,2.60,1.95,3.22,2.70,2.84,3.21,2.72,2.45,,2.28,"['HIST-097-401', 'EALC-047-401']",27558-401,HISTORY OF MODERN CHINA,/courses/27558/sections/401,HIST-097-401,401,2012A

"The course follows the evolution of industrial capitalism since the beginning of the English industrial revolution in the late 18th century. It ranges from the problems of the first industrial revolution in England to the problems of building a market economy in eastern Europe today. In particular, it examines the process of industrialization and explores the sources of sustained economic growth from a comparative perspective. Most of the world, especially in so-called emerging economies, is still confronted with the challenge, and often pain, of creating a modern industrial capitalist society. The course attempts to build a conceptual apparatus for understanding models of industrialization and is built around issues such as law, anti-trust, corporate forms, banking institutions, industrial relations, etc. By definition, the course tends to concentrate on successful industrializers around the world, but questions regarding continuing underdevelopment will be addressed.

Students felt that this course was not only entertaining and educational, but also presented information applicable to other fields and work. As one student explained, “The course taught me a lot of interesting and valuable knowledge about economic history that I have been able to apply in other areas of study.” Many students admitted that they had originally been skeptical, but were pleasantly surprised by the course. The major critique—voiced by many students—was that the course focused on presentations and discussion, while many students would have preferred more lecture and more explanation of overarching concepts. Although a few students felt that the class lacked organization, most students felt they learned a lot. According to one student, “This class blended history and economics in a way that was interesting and accessible to students from a variety of academic backgrounds. I felt that this class encouraged the development of critical thinking skills and the ability to summarize long, complex readings... This has been one of the most interesting and engaging classes I've taken at Penn.”

All students surveyed enjoyed Professor Drew’s teaching. Students felt that he was engaging, knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and able to present the content in an interesting and engaging manner. “Professor Drew was a reasonable and knowledgeable professor whose excitement and enthusiasm for the course really grasped my interest. I will certainly be back for more classes taught by him,” one student wrote. A couple of students remarked that Professor Drew was a favorite professor at Penn. As one explained, “His personable approach to teaching and his availability outside of class, particularly his interest in our paper topics and research help, has created a strong bond between Professor Drew and his students.” Professor Drew also actively engages the class through participation and presentations, which allows students to reflect on their own learning and develop important presentation skills for the future.

This class requires presentation and class participation, which the majority of students felt helped them learn the material. As one student wrote, “the professor's idea to do presentations has been very useful in helping his students learn to discuss material in front of an audience, which is a necessary skill.”",27560-001-614-JERRY-I--DREW,JERRY I.,614-JERRY-I--DREW,DREW,JERRY I.

"This course is designed as a broad introduction to the history of Jewish civilization from its Biblical beginnings until the Middle Ages. The main focus of the course is on the formative period of classical rabbinic Judaism and on the symbiotic relationship between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Course readings include the Old Testament of the Bible.

This course was enjoyable, informational, and entertaining according to almost all students surveyed. “I learned a lot on the matter, and the course also opened up my perspective,” one student wrote. A couple students specifically noted that the course put the Bible in historical context, which greatly added to their appreciation of the content and course. A few students, however, felt disconnected from the subject matter due to their religion; as one student noted, they felt “[less] invested in the subject matter (in fact, at times I felt lost because I was not Jewish…)” One student enjoyed the course because the reliance on primary source text helped them to engage with the material and with current scholarly debates regarding that material. 

Every student surveyed felt that Professor Dorhmann was “engaging, excited about the material, sharp, incredibly knowledgeable, and really invested in her students.” As one student explained, “The instructor was wonderful. [She] really stimulated student interst and was able to give over the content manner in an engaging way.” Professor Dohrmann’s teaching style “helped make the material fascinating,” and Professor Dohrmann’s demand of the classroom made every class exciting. Another student particularly liked Professor Dohrmann’s skill at “putting old and complex documents into layman’s terms and making the material relatable to those without much background knowledge.” Students also felt that Professor Dohrmann was a very fair grader. A few students, however, noted that Professor Dohrmann could move in “broad strokes” and “cover too much material” in one lecture. Despite this, the majority of students felt that “her excitement for what she's teaching is contagious, and she manages to make dry readings come to life.”

The expected workload for this class, according to students, is little until the end of the semester when there is both a final research paper (15 pages) and a final, in addition to a midterm. Many students felt there the reading was a bit lengthy — one student noted, “there was a ton of reading, but overall, it was useful and important to the course.” However, the majority of students would recommend the course to anyone, regardless of religion or major. As one student wrote, “Despite this being a class about Judaism, both Jews and non-Jews feel comfortable with how she handles the topics… She is wonderful for both freshman and seniors alike.”",27563-401-2674-NATALIE-B-DOHRMANN,NATALIE B,2674-NATALIE-B-DOHRMANN,DOHRMANN,NATALIE B DOHRMANN,/instructor/2674-NATALIE-B-DOHRMANN,30,35,/courses/27563/sections/401/reviews/2674-NATALIE-B-DOHRMANN,3.30,3.78,3.48,2.56,3.74,3.86,3.00,3.63,3.00,3.74,,2.85,"['HIST-139-401', 'NELC-051-401', 'JWST-156-401', 'NELC-451-401', 'RELS-120-401']",27563-401,JEWS & JUDAISM IN ANTQTY,/courses/27563/sections/401,HIST-139-401,401,2012A
"This course offers an intensive survey of the major currents in Jewish culture and society from the late middle ages to the present.  Focusing upon the different societies in which Jews have lived, the course explores Jewish responses to the political, socioeconomic, and cultural challenges of modernity.  Topics to be covered include the political emancipation of Jews, the creation of new religious movements within Judaism, Jewish socialism, Zionism, the Holocaust, and the emergence of new Jewish communities in Israel and the United States.  No prior background in Jewish history is expected.

	A common theme among many of the students was the feeling that they “learned a lot from this course,” and that it was both “interesting and moving,” becoming increasingly better in the latter half of the semester.  However, a number of students felt that the course was “too broad” and that it would have been nice for it to have been “narrowed down to focus on certain topics.”  A couple of students appreciated being assigned source materials instead of secondary sources as they were “very valuable in grasping the material,” but wished there could have been recitation sections where they would “be able to discuss certain issues and themes.” 

	Students liked Professor Wenger, finding her “passion for the course content obvious.”  One student found that Professor Wenger “gave very useful feedback when discussing essays or course material,” and said Professor Wenger had the “ability to communicate the subject so fluidly.”  Still, one student commented that Professor Wenger “could have done a better job engaging students vis-à-vis multimedia.”

	This course fulfills History and Tradition and Cross-Cultural Analysis for College students.  Students found the work for this course to be “manageable,” with “two papers, one midterm, and a final,” but at least one student stated that there was so much material that “absorbing the content and keeping up with the readings seemed difficult.”  Though it is a Jewish history course, one student commented that “the course would also be stimulating for non-Jews.”",27564-401-1488-BETH-S--WENGER,BETH S.,1488-BETH-S--WENGER,WENGER,BETH S.

"This course provided an introduction to the history of Asian Pacific Americans, focusing on the wide diversity of migrant experiences, as well as the continuing legacies of Orientalism on American-born APA's. Issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality were also examined.

Students enjoyed this course; several class members called the course "" quite interesting."" One student noted that there was ""a lot to cover"" in the course, but acknowledged that it was an introductory class and therefore the breadth of material ""was anticipated."" One student found that the “classes were a little bit too disengaged"" and ""would have preferred a seminar style class"" due to the professor's reputation.

Students positively reviewed Professor Azuma, calling him ""amazing,"" the ""nicest man, "" and ""dedicated."" Professor Azuma was described as ""extremely willing to help"" and ""willing to talk over the essay assignments."" Other students noted his “vast knowledge on the subject matter.""

One student described the workload of the class as ""manageable” and tests as “very fair."" Another student explained that there was ""not too much work required"" for the class, but students needed to ""keep up with the readings"" in order “to do well on the midterm and final.""",27565-401-627-EIICHIRO-AZUMA,EIICHIRO,627-EIICHIRO-AZUMA,AZUMA,EIICHIRO AZUMA,/instructor/627-EIICHIRO-AZUMA,54,59,/courses/27565/sections/401/reviews/627-EIICHIRO-AZUMA,2.48,3.00,2.67,2.07,3.02,2.87,2.30,3.29,2.73,2.30,,2.31,"['HIST-155-401', 'ASAM-003-401']",27565-401,INTRO TO ASIAN AMER HIST,/courses/27565/sections/401,HIST-155-401,401,2012A
"This course involves an analysis of the political use of force, both in theory and in practice, through analytical readings and study of selected wars.  Readings include Sun Zi, Kautilya, Machiavelli, Clauseqitz and other strategists.  Case studies vary but may include the Peloponnesian War, the Mongol conquests, the Crusades, the Crimean War, Russo-Japanese War, World War II, Korea, or the Falklands, among others, with focus on initiation, strategic alternatives, decision and termination.  There is some discussion of the law of war and international attempts to limit it.

	Overall, students found this class to be interesting and intellectually stimulating.  They reported that it was “very helpful in terms of analytical thinking,” and appreciated the fact that “the course required no prior knowledge.”  A few students noted that the first few weeks of the course required a lot of reading and that “planning was essential” to avoid falling behind, but a couple of students stated that “the professor doesn’t expect you to” complete all the readings.  One student reported that the “lectures didn’t have much form” and another wished there was more “interactive material,"" but overall students felt the class offered a “unique perspective” with information that would be “useful down the road.”

	Professor Waldron was well-liked by students, some calling him “phenomenal” and “a very interesting professor.”  While noting that he was “very open to discussion and student feedback,” a couple of students felt that he “often went on tangents” and could be “monotone at times.”  Still, he was considered “a wonderful scholar” who was “very knowledgeable and friendly.”

	Though many students considered the class to be very reading-heavy, they felt that “the workload wasn’t too bad” because not all of the readings had to be completed to understand what was going on.  Still, one student said it was helpful to be “genuinely interested in the material.”  Another student stated that he was not aware “of any class similar in nature at Penn,” and thus “really appreciated the opportunity to take this course.”",27566-001-628-ARTHUR-N--WALDRON,ARTHUR N.,628-ARTHUR-N--WALDRON,WALDRON,ARTHUR N.

"This course explores the origins, the history and, most importantly, the literary and cinematic art of the struggle that has endured for a century over the region that some call the Holy Land, some call Eretz Israel and others call Palestine.   The course considers religious motivations and interpretations that have inspired many involved in this conflict as well as the political consequences of world wars that contributed so greatly to the reconfiguration of the Middle East after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, and after the revelations of the Holocaust in Western Europe.  While the course relies on a textbook for historical grounding, the most significant material used to learn this history are films, novels and short stories. Can the arts lead us to a different understanding of the lives lived through what seems like unending crises?

Students greatly enjoyed the course overall, with one student stating that they “looked forward to going to class every week.”  The course was described to be fun, informative, and engaging, and students enjoyed the discussion format.  One student elaborated, “The content and analysis of the subject matter was insightful and interesting, and I have absolutely no doubt that it will indeed be useful down the road.

Students raved about Professor Troutt Powell as both a person and a professor.  One student described Professor Troutt Powell as “an excellent lecturer and wonderful moderator during class discussion,” with other students referring to Professor Troutt Powell as intelligent, thoughtful, kind, and humorous.  Furthermore, Professor Troutt Powell not only was clearly dedicated to delving deeper into the course material through her own research, but also “took the time within her busy schedule to ensure to talk with each individual student about their studies and career goals.”  

One student suggested the course to “anyone who has an interest in the Middle East,” regardless of major.   Graded assignments included two shorter papers, a midterm, class debates, and a longer final paper.",27567-401-3326-EVE-TROUTT-POWELL,EVE,3326-EVE-TROUTT-POWELL,TROUTT POWELL,EVE TROUTT POWELL,/instructor/3326-EVE-TROUTT-POWELL,23,30,/courses/27567/sections/401/reviews/3326-EVE-TROUTT-POWELL,3.25,3.65,3.57,2.80,3.26,3.73,3.00,3.90,3.53,3.75,,2.80,"['HIST-166-401', 'CINE-166-401']",27567-401,ARB/ISR CON LIT & FILM: Arab-Israeli Conflict Through Literature and Film,/courses/27567/sections/401,HIST-166-401,401,2012A

"This course traces the history of the American South from the end of the Civil War to the present. It investigates Reconstruction, the New South, Populism, racial disfranchisement and the rise of Jim Crow, the politics of the One-Party-South, the South in the Progressive era and its role in the New Deal and World War II, the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, and the rise of the Republican South. While following the narrative of politics and economic development, the course pays particular attention to race relations and is more than casually interested in gender roles. In addition, it takes frequent peeks at the evolving Southern identity as reflected in popular culture and literature as well as in other corners of the public sphere. 

Overall, students found this course to be extremely interesting and informative, and it provided many students a fresh perspective on US History far beyond what they had learned in high school Advanced Placement courses. Many students even said it was one of the best courses they have taken at Penn to date. The one complaint regarding course material, voiced by several students, was that they watched too many videos during class time, which some felt was a “waste” given how interesting the course material was. 

Professor Hahn received rave reviews from his students, who described Professor Hahn as an incredible lecturer and an “absolute master of history.” Several students commented that Professor Hahn’s lectures were so clear and engaging that they never wanted to miss a class. In addition, one student complimented Professor Hahn on, “always [having] relevant conclusions and [tying] historical events to modern situations with ease.” All in all, students were grateful for the opportunity to take a course from Professor Hahn. 

One of the only, yet frequently repeated, criticisms of the course was that there was a very copious, and in one student’s words even “impossible,” amount of reading. This was especially surprising for some students given that it is an introductory course. That said, many students expressed that the assessments were not excessive and were generally graded fairly. A few non-history majors said they would recommend this course to other non-majors; in the words of one of these students, “I am not a ‘history person’ but nonetheless found this course incredibly interesting.” One student warned, however, that history majors might prefer a course that is more detailed and has less pop history appeal than this course.

"A study of the major events, issues, and personalities in Afro-American history from Reconstruction to the present. It will also examine the different slave experiences and the methods of black resistance and rebellion in the various slave systems. 
 
This course serves as a broad exploration of African-American history from 1876 through the present.  Students were generally quite pleased with the course.  Many students considered “a valuable foundation” for further study and a “well-organized course.”  A few students found the material to be “a bit of a review,” but most found the lectures and readings “insightful.”

Students praised Professor Savage as an outstanding historian and lecturer.  Students found her enthusiasm for the material “contagious.”  She was further described as “knowledgeable,” “interesting,” and “thoughtful.”  Students especially appreciated Professor Savage’s investment in their progress and understanding.  Many participants also noted how well Professor Savage incorporates “various media” to convey concepts.

Students found the course appropriately challenging.  Many commented that “a lot of reading” is required in order to succeed.

"Western thinkers from the ancient Greeks to the present have speculated about what the ideal human society would look like.  We can study the resultant utopias as works of literature, philosophy, religion, psychology or political science; we must understand them in their historical contexts.  This seminar takes a multidisciplinary approach to utopian thought from Plato's Republic to the ecological utopias of the 1980s.  Works examined include More's Utopia; seventeenth century scientific utopias like Bacon's New Atlantis; the political theory of Rousseau (Social Contract); essays of the French utopian socialists and Hawthorne's version of the Brook Farm experiment; Morris' News from Nowhere; its American counterpart, Bellamy's Looking Backward; Gilman's feminist blueprint, Herland; BF Skinner's psychological utopia, Walden Two; and the utopian science fiction of LeGuin.  Huxley's dystopia, Brave New World, will be set against his later utopia, Island.

This heavily discussion-based seminar was greatly enjoyed by a majority of students.  Almost all students commented on the level of deep thinking cultivated over the course of the semester by the readings and structure, and were grateful for the experience. 

Students greatly appreciated Professor Todd’s teachings and methods, and found Professor Todd’s passion about the material to be quite evident.  One student’s “writing improved tremendously from Professor Todd’s comments.” Generally, students found Professor Todd to be good at stimulating discussion, although a few students wished Professor Todd had interjected a few more of her own thoughts during student-led discussions.  

This course is an advanced seminar, mainly for juniors and seniors in the Benjamin Franklin Scholars Program.  All other students need permission from the instructor to enroll in the course.  The course required a fair amount of work, as judged by students.  In addition to a few written assignments, the course required the reading of approximately a book per week plus journal entries.  One student stated that if one is prepared to put in the time and effort to complete the assigned work and engage in class discussions, then one “is basically guaranteed an A.”  Most students recommend this class to anyone who enjoys reading and discussing.

"In this course students read what many consider to be the greatest book in world literature.  This work, Tolstoy’s War and Peace, is devoted to one of the most momentous periods in world history, the Napoleonic Era (1789-1815).  Students study both the novel and the era of the Napoleonic Wars: the military campaigns of Napoleon and his opponents, the grand strategies of the age, political intrigues and diplomatic betrayals, the ideologies and human dramas, the relationship between art and history.  How does literature help us to understand this era?  How does history help us to understand this great novel? 

Students absolutely raved about the course material and format.  One student mentioned that if they were to begin mentioning all the good things about the course, the student “would be writing an evaluation whose length would rival War and Peace itself.”  The class integrated both a literary analysis component and a historical component, making it “innovative.”  

Students raved about the dynamic between the two professors.  One student lauded the department for having both a literature and history professor, which “provided for a more comprehensive, interdisciplinary understanding of War and Peace, which added substantial value to the class.”  The professors “were constantly engaging with one another, always open to students' questions, and genuinely wanted students to immerse themselves in the Tolstoyan experience.”  Professor Vinitsky was described not only as brilliant, but able to stimulate interest in the material and engage with students during lectures.  

Coursework included two major written assignments and a handful of quizzes.  The course required weekly reading of between 150-300 pages per week, and students warned that if reading large amounts was difficult for a particular student, he or she may think twice before enrolling in this course.  Overall, students highly recommended this course, in many of their words, “one of the best at Penn.”  One student elaborated, “I recommend this course to anyone, but particularly to freshmen, because it serves as a great inspiration for further courses of a similar nature.”  Another student recommended this course to history and English majors in particular, “if only to meet the professors,” as well as to non-majors looking to expand their breadth of knowledge.

"This course examined the history, politics, and significance of foreign aid to Africa since the late 19th century. While people do not typically think about the European colonial period in Africa in terms of 'foreign aid,' that era introduced ideas and institutions which formed the foundations for modern aid policies and practices. So students started there and moved forward into more contemporary times. In addition to examining the objectives behind foreign assistance and the intentions of donors and recipients, the course looked at some of the consequences (intended or unintended) of various forms of foreign aid to Africa over the past century. While not designed to be a comprehensive history of development theory, of African economics, or of international aid organizations, the course touched on all of these topics. Previous course work on Africa was strongly advised.

Students found the course interesting, but found the subject matter was never systematically resolved. Some students felt comfortable with this, calling it the sort of class that ""results in a lot more questions than answers"" but those questions promote discussion. One student found the course had ""less historical focus than expected"" and thought that ""more historical grounding would have enhanced the course."" Other students wanted the class to be ""more structured,"" but one student said that, despite the ""scattered"" nature of class, caused by ""Dr. Cassanelli's many interests,"" ""class was always a delight.""

Overall, students found Professor Cassanelli ""interesting,"" ""stimulating,"" ""passionate,"" and ""knowledgeable.""  One student praised his ability to be ""flexible and responsive, tailoring class to the interests of the students."" Another student described his ""excitement"" for foreign aid in Africa as ""contagious.""

One student particularly appreciated the readings, calling them ""very interesting,"" though the student wanted to learn more ""about successful cases of foreign aid."" Other students expressed dismay over the grading; one student claimed that the ""assignments were not graded in a timely manner"" and another did not like Professor Cassanelli's system of grading, explaining that there was ""no feedback on grades—just scores without any explanation."" Multiple students also praised the guest speakers brought in to the class.",27588-401-658-LEE-V-CASSANELLI,LEE V,658-LEE-V-CASSANELLI,CASSANELLI,LEE V CASSANELLI,/instructor/658-LEE-V-CASSANELLI,37,42,/courses/27588/sections/401/reviews/658-LEE-V-CASSANELLI,3.06,3.10,3.11,2.19,3.48,3.42,3.10,3.48,2.77,3.03,,2.29,"['HIST-372-401', 'AFST-372-401']",27588-401,HIST FOREIGN AID IN AFRC,/courses/27588/sections/401,HIST-372-401,401,2012A
"This course examines the political, cultural, and intellectual history of America between 1954 and 1974. It considers the civil rights movement, the New Frontier and Great Society, the Supreme Court and right politics, the rise of the New Right, the debate over Vietnam, student radicalism, sexual liberation movements, black power, the counterculture, the urban crisis, and white backlash. The course emphasizes the transformation of liberalism and the revitalization of conservatism, and the tensions between integration and separatism, between libertarianism and communitarianism that shaped the social movements of the sixties.

Students expressed immense satisfaction with this course.  Class members appreciated both the content as well as the manner in which it was presented.  A few students noted that the breadth of material occasionally made certain topics seem “rushed,” however, more students praised the “level of depth” of the lectures and readings, alike.  Students claimed that class meetings appeared “to fly by.”  

Professor Sugrue received tremendous praise as an “enthusiastic,” “engaging,” and “dynamic” professor.  Students valued his use of “humor and anecdotes” to enhance the concepts.  He was further described as “knowledgeable and passionate” about his subject matter.  Students regretted that the course was so large, which hindered their ability to develop personal relationships with Professor Sugrue, despite his availability and approachability.

Students found the workload “challenging, but worthwhile.”  Readings were “quite lengthy”, but were not considered too burdensome because they were “so interesting.”  Students expressed a bit of frustration that there were not frequent assessments – just a midterm and final.  However, students found the tests fair, so long as readings had been completed and class had been attended.  As the course is a higher-level course, many students were history majors, but a considerable number of non-majors took the course as well.  Both categories overwhelmingly recommended the course to others.

"This course examines the international politics of Europe in the 20th Century, the period during which Europe, beset by two devastating wars and the horrific experience of genocide, lost its dominant international position and was forced to adjust to a world dominated by extra-European forces.  This course examines the decline and (partial) recovery of Europe's international position with special attention to the contrast between international competition and transnational cooperation within Europe, the impact of the two World Wars, the ambivalent legacy of the Cold War, and Europe's developing role in the post-Cold War world.

	Students generally enjoyed this course, which “did a good job of combining both history and international relations theory into its material.” Students felt it was a “valuable introduction to world affairs in the 20th century,” but many noted that there was “way too much material for too little time.” Lectures were described as “very dry,” with many students wishing for a more “dynamic lecture” experience instead of the professor just “reading off the slides.” The slides themselves were difficult to follow, and students complained about overwhelming reading that did not always relate to what was covered in lecture.

	Professor Ogle received mixed reviews from students. Many liked that she was “very approachable” and was always willing to meet with students, even attending certain recitations to better get to know students. Students all noted that she was very knowledgeable about the subject matter but had trouble organizing her lecture slides and “could work towards presenting the subject in a slightly more engaging way.” Many had problems with her teaching style, criticizing her “monotonous and boring” lectures and wishing she would do more than “essentially read off her notes.” 

	This course was described as having a good amount of work, with “excessively lengthy” readings and a midterm and final. Some students felt Professor Ogle was “vague on what she wanted on her tests, which made it confusing and frustrating to write to,” and others felt “the assignments had not quite been ironed out.” Students said the tests required too much information to be conveyed in too little time frame, and noted recitations “required an unnecessary amount of work and participation.” Overall, students recommended this course as an informative way to learn about European international relations but stressed the need for the course structure to become more engaging.",27594-001-5761-VANESSA-OGLE,VANESSA,5761-VANESSA-OGLE,OGLE,VANESSA OGLE,/instructor/5761-VANESSA-OGLE,69,78,/courses/27594/sections/1/reviews/5761-VANESSA-OGLE,2.61,2.86,2.67,2.31,3.04,2.63,2.86,3.18,2.06,2.06,,2.58,['HIST-421-001'],27594-001,EURO INT'L REL SINCE WWI,/courses/27594/sections/1,HIST-421-001,001,2012A
"This course is designed to explore the diplomatic origins, military course, and domestic implications of World War II. 

The majority of students said this course was their favorite at Penn. According to students, “Although the course is very specifically confined to WWII, it also brings up an issue that we still don't have an answer to today -- the morality of war.”  As one stated, “One of the best courses at Penn. Period.” Many students believed they learned a lot from this course. One student noted that “the class [was] very interesting, pace was great, and I was able to learn a lot.” Many students were amazed by the course quality and many agreed the sentiment that it was a class they consistently looked forward to attending. Almost every student found the course extremely engaging, to the degree that many commented that they lost track of time while in lecture.  Another student noted, “I was not disappointed with this class. It was exciting and challenging. I will miss it dearly.”

According to many reviewers, Professor Childers’s reputation as “a god” has been well earned. Many students described Childers as incredible. One wrote, “I love Childers. He is my hero. Actually. His lectures are like stories. With cliffhangers and protagonists and antagonists.” Another agreed, explaining that “during most lectures he had the entire class on the edge of their seats.” Every single reviewer found that Childers was unquestionably knowledgeable about the material. Although a few thought that Childers lived up to — and, at times, exceeded — his reputation, a few students felt that “the legend of this course and professor sometimes overshadow the content and experience of the class.” A couple of students struggled to connect the lectures to the readings and felt it was difficult to take notes on class. As one student noted, “While Childers is a wonderful story-teller, he can sometimes lose sight of the fact that he’s teaching.” A few other students found that although Childers was available for discussion, his fan club filled his office hours and limited student-professor interaction. 

A few students suggested that this course should be made mandatory for all students. The majority of students would recommend the course to a major or non-major. One noted that this “is a must-take class for anyone with WII interest.” Another student said that, “This is a class that you must take an undergraduate at Penn.” However, a few students found that the course was unnecessarily difficult. A large portion of students also felt that it was difficult to keep up with the readings. The course also requires weekly journal entries and analytical essays, with an emphasis on recitations. A couple of students also found that they did not know what to expect on the exam and that there was “a large disconnect between students and the professor.”",27595-001-655-THOMAS-C-CHILDERS,THOMAS C,655-THOMAS-C-CHILDERS,CHILDERS,THOMAS C CHILDERS,/instructor/655-THOMAS-C-CHILDERS,193,217,/courses/27595/sections/1/reviews/655-THOMAS-C-CHILDERS,3.36,3.71,3.45,2.53,2.82,3.61,3.25,3.84,3.42,3.60,,2.73,['HIST-431-001'],27595-001,A WORLD AT WAR,/courses/27595/sections/1,HIST-431-001,001,2012A

"The Roman Empire was one of the few great world states—one that unified a large area around the Mediterranean Sea—an area never subsequently united as part of a single state. Whereas the great achievements of the Greeks were in the realm of ideas and concepts (democracy, philosophy, art, literature, drama) those of the Romans tended to be in the pragmatic spheres of ruling and controlling subject peoples and integrating them under the aegis of an imperial state. Conquest, warfare, administration, and law making were the great successes of the Roman state. This course looks at this process from its inception and traces the formation of Rome's Mediterranean empire over the last three centuries BC; it then considesr the social, economic and political consequences of this great achievement, especially the great political transition from the Republic (rule by the Senate) to the Principate (rule by emperors). The course also considers limitations to Roman power and various types of challenges, military, cultural, and religious, to the hegemony of the Roman state. Finally, students try to understand the process of the development of a distinctive Roman culture from the emergence new forms of literature, like satire, to the gladiatorial arena as typical elements that contributed to a Roman social order. 

Reviews of this course were overwhelmingly positive. One student even proclaimed, “This was the best class I’ve taken in my entire life.” Students commented that for the amount that they ended up learning, it was well worth it to do all the readings and attend all the lectures. One student also enjoyed “the emphasis on concepts and themes rather than just slogging through the history in a chronological manner.” 

Professor Grey is described by many of his students as a phenomenal lecturer whose “enthusiasm is clearly evident.” Professor Grey is also praised by several students for not just lecturing, but also opening up the class to questions and involved discussion. Finally, several students appreciated that Professor Grey was very approachable outside of class and supportive of his students.  

Most of the complaints lodged against the course had to do with the work it required. A few students commented that the readings seemed to be tangential to the main focus of the course. Many students also expressed that the amount of work was copious and unreasonable. However, another student countered that the readings were, “crucial for a full understanding of the course.” In addition, while some students warned that students should only take this course if they have a very genuine interest in learning about Ancient Rome, other students said they would recommend the course to anyone. One previously non-Ancient Studies major reflected, “This course influenced me to change my major entirely from systems engineering to history.” This course fulfills the History & Tradition Sector requirement.",26933-401-2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY,CAMPBELL AINSWORTH,2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY,GREY,CAMPBELL AINSWORTH GREY,/instructor/2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY,128,155,/courses/26933/sections/401/reviews/2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY,2.65,3.08,2.84,2.47,2.76,3.10,2.61,3.40,2.55,2.90,,2.86,"['ANCH-027-401', 'HIST-027-401']",26933-401,ANCIENT ROME,/courses/26933/sections/401,ANCH-027-401,401,2012A

"This course tackles about a millennium of pre-modern Japanese political, social, and cultural history (roughly, 700-1700). Instead of attempting to cover the period chronologically, as an introductory survey might, this class is structured as a series of case studies. Each of these will take a primary source as its point of departure and explore one or more facets of Japanese history and writing. In the course of each case study, lectures and discussions will branch out from the main source to examine its historical context as well as the (political, cultural, textual) traditions that informed that source s composition. In general, students will read the entire texts of the main sources (or significant portions of them), along with scholarly articles and shorter excerpts from other sources, composed at the same time or in the same vein/genre. During lectures and discussions alike, students will be asked to engage the readings, so as to grasp the specifics of Japanese history and practice the analytical skills required of historical discourse.

Overall, students found this course worthwhile, with a few notable drawbacks.  Students considered the class a success “thematically,” but less so in providing an “authoritative history.”  In particular, the emphasis on primary texts left many students feeling uncertain about “factual historical details.”  Nonetheless, students found class discussions and readings “interesting.”

Students greatly appreciated Professor Spafford’s passion for his subject matter.  He was described as a “thoughtful professor” and his knowledge of the material was praised as “encyclopedic.”  Participants particularly valued his “genuine desire to convey his knowledge” on Japanese history, rather than forcing students to memorize the material.  He was also perceived as approachable and “friendly.”

The course workload was generally reviewed as “fair,” however students noted that the readings were “considerably too long to complete.”  Assignments were manageable, especially because Professor Spafford was “easygoing and flexible with deadlines.”  Most students enrolled in the course because it related to their broader course of study, although a few noted that it “turned them on to the topic of Japanese history.”",27241-401-5733-DAVID-SPAFFORD,DAVID,5733-DAVID-SPAFFORD,SPAFFORD,DAVID SPAFFORD,/instructor/5733-DAVID-SPAFFORD,19,21,/courses/27241/sections/401/reviews/5733-DAVID-SPAFFORD,2.73,3.13,2.44,2.33,3.07,2.89,3.07,3.13,1.93,2.40,,2.53,"['EALC-270-401', 'HIST-277-401', 'EALC-670-401']",27241-401,SHAMANS TO SAMURAI,/courses/27241/sections/401,EALC-270-401,401,2012A
"This course focuses on health and healing in the colonial and post-colonial world.  We give special attention to local healing under condition of domination, to definitions of the body and the person in biomedicine and in non-European healing traditions, and to the political and cultural place of medicine in regions which have experienced colonial rule.

A majority of students seemed to enjoy this “interesting” and “engaging” course, although some students felt the material was oftentimes “confusing” and “rushed.” The course required a lot of work, but most students felt it was enjoyable and had a great time doing the outside readings and assignments.

Most students remarked upon how organized Professor Feierman was and what an enjoyable lecturer he was to listen to. He was described as “extremely passionate.” Students could tell that he “definitely cared about his lectures and students.”

"This course is the second half of the Near East sequence. It surveys Islamic civilization from the rise of Islam at around 600 A.D. to the start of the modern era. Major focuses of the course include political, social, and cultural trends. Although the emphasis is on Middle Eastern societies, the course also offers insight into developments in other parts of the world where Islamic civilization was or has been influential, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia, and Spain. The goal of this course is to understand the shared features that have distinguished Islamic civilization as well as the varieties of experience that have endowed it with so much diversity.

Many students reported enjoying this course. One said it was an “[e]xcellent course on history of the Middle East” and many others agreed. While many agreed that the course content was great, many students noted that they would have preferred this course if it had been “a small seminar with 8-10 students, instead of the current format with 25-40.”  Many students also felt frustrated with the assignments and felt that they “didn’t really enhance the understanding of the course material.” Another student agreed, adding, “The writing assignments weren’t tied to what [was] actually learned in class.”

Almost all the students agreed that Professor Cobb is extremely knowledgeable about the course material. Students raved about Professor Cobb, calling him incredible, excellent, and very engaging. Yet another student noted that he “established that he was willing to help in [any way] that he could [and was] a phenomenal lecturer.” According to the majority of students, Professor Cobb “did a terrific job of communicating the subject matter, delivering his lectures with didactic precision interlaced with humor.” However, a couple of students found his humor to be “at times very sarcastic” and noted that he “can be a little bit hard to follow.”

The majority of reviewers noted that the grading for this course could be very difficult depending on the TA. One student said “the TA… graded [assignments] unfairly” while another said that the grading “was excessively harsh.” However, many students would recommend this course to a major or non-major and anyone “even mildly interested in the history of the Middle East” — although one reviewer warned that subject matter can be “slightly redundant if you have taken other courses on the Middle East.” This course satisfies the History & Tradition Sector and the Cross Cultural Analysis.",27848-401-4473-PAUL-MICHAEL-COBB,PAUL MICHAEL,4473-PAUL-MICHAEL-COBB,COBB,PAUL MICHAEL COBB,/instructor/4473-PAUL-MICHAEL-COBB,24,29,/courses/27848/sections/401/reviews/4473-PAUL-MICHAEL-COBB,2.88,3.50,2.88,2.58,3.21,3.50,2.79,3.46,2.65,3.25,,2.67,"['NELC-102-401', 'HIST-023-401']",27848-401,INTRO TO MIDDLE EAST,/courses/27848/sections/401,NELC-102-401,401,2012A

"Sugar and Spices.  Tea and Coffee.  Opium and Cocaine.  Hop aboard the Indian Ocean dhows, Chinese junks, Dutch schooners, and British and American clipper ships that made possible the rise of global capitalism, new colonial relationships, and the intensified forms of cultural change.  How have the desires to possess and consume particular commodities shaped cultures and the course of modern history?  This class introduces students to the cultural history of the modern world through an interdisciplinary analysis of connections between East and West, South and North.  Following the circulation of commodities and the development of modern capitalism, the course examines the impact of global exchange on interactions and relationships between regions, nations, cultures, and peoples and the influences on cultural practices and meanings.  The role of slavery and labor migrations, colonial and imperial relations, and struggles for economic and political independence are also considered. From the role of spices in the formation of European joint stock companies circa 1600 to the contemporary cocaine trade, the course's use of both original primary sources and secondary readings written by historians and anthropologists will enable particular attention to the ways that global trade has impacted social, cultural, and political formations and practices throughout the world. Recitation will not meet every week.  Lecture sessions will be shortened those weeks that recitations are held.

	Students loved this “immensely interesting” class, with many calling it one of their favorite courses at Penn. Described as “a wonderful synthesis between different schools of thinking,” students appreciated the amount of material covered, with one student “truly shocked by how much [he/she] learned from this course.” There were several long but “well-selected” reading assignments, and most students felt the engaging lectures and course content made the readings manageable.

	Professor Mitchell received raves from her students, and was described as “fantastic,” “incredibly engaging,” and “brilliant.” Students loved her ability to “make every single lecture interesting and informative” as well as her attention to student concerns about the workload. Many students praised her enthusiasm and dedication to the subject. Several students attributed the course’s success to Mitchell’s “terrific” teaching style, with many claiming she is “one of the most incredible lecturers” at Penn.

	While the workload for the course was oftentimes heavy, with several readings, many appreciated Professor Mitchell making “it very clear as to what big picture topics [they] should know by the end of it all.” The one major criticism of the course concerned a voiceover PowerPoint project, with students complaining about the difficulty of using the technology. Though many students took the class to fulfill the Humanities and Social Sciences sector, the interesting course content and professor made it well worth taking, with one student saying they were “so glad I stumbled upon it.” This course is recommended for both History and South Asian Studies majors as well as non-majors who have not yet taken a history course at Penn.",28126-401-4096-LISA-MITCHELL,LISA,4096-LISA-MITCHELL,MITCHELL,LISA MITCHELL,/instructor/4096-LISA-MITCHELL,105,114,/courses/28126/sections/401/reviews/4096-LISA-MITCHELL,2.91,3.56,3.23,2.02,3.44,3.58,2.69,3.37,3.21,3.37,,2.36,"['SAST-063-401', 'ANTH-063-401', 'HIST-087-401']",28126-401,EAST/WEST:MDRN WRLD HIST: East&West: A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Cultural History of the Modern World,/courses/28126/sections/401,SAST-063-401,401,2012A
"This course will explore the emergence of modern science fiction as a genre, the ways it has reflected our evolving conceptions of ourselves and the universe, and its role as the mythology of modern technological civilization. Students will discuss such characteristic themes as utopias, the exploration of space and time, biological engineering, superman, robots, aliens, and other worlds--and the differences between European and American treatment of these themes.
	The course was noted for the amount of reading, which made one student feel as though his course load was “6 instead of 5.” Another student described it simply as an “excellent course,” while many others noted the high level of reading required. Most students were united in praise of the course material, which was described as “well-chosen,” but some thought that there was too much covered in the class to truly get a firm handle on the material. 
Professor Adams was described as “an excellent lecturer” for the course, as well as providing a “wealth of information” and “very valuable insights.” Students enjoyed his stories “about the Soviet Union” as well as his being an “avid science fiction reader.

"The course traces the economic, social, and political history of American cities after World War II. It focuses on how the economic problems of the industrial city were compounded by the racial conflicts of the 1950s and 1960s and the fiscal crises of the 1970s. The last part of the course examines the forces that have led to the revitalization of cities in recent years.
	Students criticized this course as having “too much reading” and were surprised to find that they had to read “300 pages a week” for a 100 level course. The classroom discussions were characterized as “never too great” and the course as a whole was seen as a disappointment by many students. It was further described as not very “dynamic” and the classes were seen as hard to get through.
	Professor Hanson was described by his students as “not approachable” and a “bit scattered.” Many felt that he came to class “unprepared” many a time, and further described him as “disorganized.” Some felt that Professor Hanson turned what could have been interesting material into a bore.
	This class fulfills the Society Sector Requirement, and was not recommended by any students. The difficulty of the class was seen as very high, mostly as a result of the “insane” amount of reading that students were expected to do every week.

"This course is an introduction to major forces that shape urban life in the United States from the eighteenth century to the present, with a focus on Philadelphia. Through weekly assignments and discussions, students will examine the physical formation and historical development of cities and learn to ""read"" the sociological and geographic organization of the contemporary city. Prominent themes include urban growth, decline, and restructuring; the ecological bases of urban life; race, class, and gender relations in urban space; and the formation and re-formation of neighborhoods, downtowns, and suburbs.
	Students were positive about the course, praising it as “dynamic” and “stimulating.” However, many students felt that the course could be improved by having less student-led discussions, which were faulted as being “somewhat boring.”  Even students who criticized the student discussions mentioned that they “learned a lot from the class” and noted that they still enjoyed it. 
	Professor Schneider was described as an “expert lecturer” and was noted for his willingness to “help students.” He was also commended for having  “put more work” into the class than “any other professor.” However, his grading system was faulted as being somewhat “biased or unfair” and confusing due to papers being graded out of 3.0. 
	This course was described as having a “fantastic curve,” but it was also noted by students that there was a “lot of reading.” Students were united in their praise of Professor Schnieder, who was noted as being “one of the premier urban studies specialists” in the field. This class fulfills the Humanities and Social Sciences Sector Requirement.  This course was recommended for both majors and non-majors.",28234-401-1191-ERIC-C--SCHNEIDER,ERIC C.,1191-ERIC-C--SCHNEIDER,SCHNEIDER,ERIC C.
