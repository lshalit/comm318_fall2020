"Psychology 001 is an introductory course that covers basic topics of psychology, including learning, motivation, cognition, development, abnormal, physiological, social, and personality.

Several students believed that Professor Rozin included a detrimental amount of extraneous information in his classes. One student emphasized that “the Professor does not teach Psychology in class. He talks about random topics, discusses random studies, and I do not think he ties it all together.” However, another student stated: “I really enjoy this class. It seems like learning for the sake of knowledge rather than for the sake of grading, which is a welcome and refreshing change.”

In describing Professor Rozin, one student mentioned that he was a “very energetic and charismatic person” and that he “is known across campus as being very comedic and approachable.” Contrastingly, another student, baffled by Professor Rozin’s teaching style, wrote that “Prof Rozin does not make sense to me. His teaching style is really confusing and I am not always able to make a connection to the readings or anything else for that matter. I wish it was more logical.” 

Several students complained about the numerous, voluminous multiple choice exams administered in this class. Specifically, one student state that “the examinations were just nit-picking details with no regard for general concepts and broad ideas.” As far as examinations, one student believed that Professor Rozin “wrote exams that seemed themselves to be more of a psych experiment than a test in that they were made to be confusing and did not test information or concepts learned.” Similarly, another student believed that “the tests are difficult because half is on lectures and half on the textbook. You really have to understand the concepts to pass the tests.

"This course serves as an introduction to the basic topics of psychology, including learning, motivation, cognition, development, abnormal, physiological, social, and personality. The major controversies in psychology provide the binding themes in the course, such as nature versus nurture and theories about the relationship between mind and body. Students examine some of the ‘grand’ questions that psychologists have posed and investigated—what forces shape our behavior, who do we love and why, what is prejudice and who conforms, and do we think and behave rationally. This class satisfies the Living World requirement and serves as a prerequisite for all psychology classes numbered 100 and above.

Most of the students found the assigned readings, which included publications, to be valuable and “thoughtfully selected,” but some felt that the course material veered a bit from the textbook. Thus, these students were left unsure of their preparedness for future courses. Multiple students noted that the exams were exceedingly difficult for an introductory course and somewhat subjective. Some found the discussion to be basic, though helpful. Students found in-class videos to be a valuable supplement for material learned in class.

Professor Jayawickreme received mix responses from his students. While some praised the environment of open discussion he created, others were irked by his allowing “continuous questions” that interrupted lectures and caused the class to run behind schedule. In general though, students found him “approachable,” “friendly,” able to stimulate interest, and very willing to discuss course content after lecture.

This section of the course was in the College of Liberal and Professional Studies (LPS) and included a mixture of students from both LPS and the College. Though some found the assessments to be too difficult for an introductory course, no students stated they felt terribly overwhelmed by the workload.",16375-601-3603-NUWAN-D-JAYAWICKREME,NUWAN D,3603-NUWAN-D-JAYAWICKREME,JAYAWICKREME,NUWAN D JAYAWICKREME,/instructor/3603-NUWAN-D-JAYAWICKREME,34,37,/courses/16375/sections/601/reviews/3603-NUWAN-D-JAYAWICKREME,2.57,2.62,2.32,2.76,2.90,2.65,2.52,2.86,2.45,2.62,,2.31,['PSYC-001-601'],16375-601,INTRO TO EXP PSYCH,/courses/16375/sections/601,PSYC-001-601,601,2009A
"This course looks at animal behavior from a psychological perspective. Content includes the evolution of social behavior in animals with special emphasis on group formation, cooperation among kin, mating systems, territoriality and communication. Prerequisites are either PSYC 001 or BIOL 102.

Many students found the textbook readings in the class to be ineffective, but most did enjoy the outside articles assigned for reading. Students also found the videos to be mostly helpful and wished there would have been more. The responses suggested that students felt well-informed after taking the class but found the exams to be overly focused on memorization of details rather than true “cognitive” ability. By far the most negative aspect of the course, which stood out in almost all of the reviews, was the grading of exams, which was found to be “arbitrary” and “inconsistent”. Students felt that TAs only looked for certain key points in essays, and anything else was ignored. Many students noted that the TAs refused to give way on their grading of exams, and there was no option of re-grade.

Professor Cheney was found to be among the “best biology professors” by the students. Students praised her adeptness at being able to “capture interest” in such a large class. One student noted that she was difficult to reach for questions just before exams, but almost all students saw her as a great lecturer with a wealth of experience in the field.

The course is generally meant for psychology majors in the College, though biology and biological basis of behavior (BIBB) students were in the course as well. Students recommended the course to biology and psychology majors, but one BIBB student did not think it really fit into the major. From an administrative standpoint, multiple students felt that recitations should have been set up in the registrar beforehand rather than produced ad hoc during the course.

Though one or two students thought that Professor Seyfarth was too “repetitive,” he was almost universally found to be very “articulate” and thoroughly “engaged” with the material. Virtually all student responses noted that his lectures were interesting and informative, and many students felt blessed to be learning from someone so “accomplished in his field.” Multiple students praised him as the best professor they’ve had at Penn.

"This course looks at attention and memory in humans with a modern experimental focus. Topics include multiple memory systems, attentional selection, the interrelationship between memory and attention, dysfunction due to disease states and aging, exceptional functioning, and strategies to improve memory and attentional processes. Particular emphasis is given to the neural basis of cognitive processes. Prerequisites include PSYC 001 or BIBB 109.
The course was taught mostly in a lecture-style format off of Power Point slides with some demonstrations and activities. Students found these activities to be stimulating and wished there had been more. Providing the slides beforehand was also cited as a way of improving the course. The content was generally thought to be complex, but the slides were found to serve as a good complement to the readings, which multiple students described as “dense,” especially the PDF articles. The review sessions provided by the TA before exams were almost universally described as “useless” and many cited the TA as not very well-versed in the course material.

Students had wide-ranging opinions of Professor Jha, which generally correlated with their level of interaction with her. Some found her to be an “engaging” lecturer who “knows what she’s talking about,” while others felt she may have been a bit “condescending” or “snappy” even during office hours. Those who did not find her to be a great lecturer cited that she often read directly off of her lecture slides, which made the course material a bit “dry” and less exciting than expected. On the other hand, students who praised her teaching skills found her slides to be informative, felt she did a good job of communicating difficult material, and described her as “accessible.” She took a brief leave during the course, during which a substitute taught lectures, which many students lamented because of Professor Jha’s great teaching ability.

No students complained about the workload aside from some of the readings being described as “dense.” Students recommended this course to psychology majors, though those with limited background in memory and attention found the class to be very different from what they expected.",16377-001-1948-AMISHI-P-JHA,AMISHI P,1948-AMISHI-P-JHA,JHA,AMISHI P JHA,/instructor/1948-AMISHI-P-JHA,80,82,/courses/16377/sections/1/reviews/1948-AMISHI-P-JHA,2.72,3.07,2.76,3.01,2.32,2.99,1.92,3.30,1.84,3.03,,2.24,['PSYC-155-001'],16377-001,ATTENTION & MEMORY,/courses/16377/sections/1,PSYC-155-001,001,2009A

&#8232;The course received mixed reviews from students; some said that it was a good course that covered very interesting topics while others thought that it was dry and simply a repeat of Psychology 001. Students were not impressed with Professor Simmons’ lectures, but they enjoyed the supplemental materials such as videos, outside readings, and case studies. “The readings were more interesting than sitting in the lecture,” said one student. &#8232;&#8232;
Most students though that Professor Simmons was “dry,” “boring,” and “simply regurgitated the readings in the book.” A few students did say however that she was “helpful,” and “clearly knowledgeable,” In general, the students felt comfortable approaching the professor both in and out of class for help and clarification of the lectures.&#8232;&#8232;

"Positive psychology is the scientific study of happiness, meaning, engagement, accomplishment, and virtue. This course focuses on valid assessments of these constructs, their causes and correlates, and interventions that have been shown to promote them. In addition to reading selected textbook chapters and primary research articles, students will complete positive psychology exercises and reflect upon their experience in written assignments

Overall, students described this course on “happy-ology” as having “great potential.” Many students raved about Professor Duckworth’s “energetic” teaching, but complained that the course sometimes “lacked focus” and “will be better next semester when some of the kinks are worked out.” Students praised lectures as “fun” and “creative,” but had mixed feelings about the recitations added on to the course requirements.

Almost every student pointed to Professor Duckworth as the reason they enjoyed this course, describing her as “phenomenal” and “enthusiastic.” As a first-time professor, a few students noted that Duckworth “could use more practice” and had some problems with time management and lecture planning. However, students concurred that Professor Duckworth’s “dynamic,” “approachable,” and “exuberant” teaching style made her class worth taking.

Students’ biggest criticism were the “extremely challenging multiple choice exams” which “didn’t adequately reflect what” students knew based on lectures alone. Many found that the “readings were overwhelming at times” but pointed out that Professor Duckworth decreased the reading burden late in the semester. One student recommended taking a statistics course before enrolling, but most suggested the class to anyone truly interested in “learning about happiness and how to improve your own well-being.”",16379-001-3612-ANGELA-L-DUCKWORTH,ANGELA L,3612-ANGELA-L-DUCKWORTH,DUCKWORTH,ANGELA L DUCKWORTH,/instructor/3612-ANGELA-L-DUCKWORTH,118,123,/courses/16379/sections/1/reviews/3612-ANGELA-L-DUCKWORTH,2.40,2.96,2.63,2.53,3.12,3.00,2.21,3.04,2.45,2.92,,2.65,['PSYC-166-001'],16379-001,INTRO.POSITIVE PSYCH.,/courses/16379/sections/1,PSYC-166-001,001,2009A

While students felt that this course’s material was interesting, they reported largely “disorganized” lectures that were “poorly integrated” with readings and “irrelevant” to exam questions. Comments focused on the “very difficult” exams that students felt had a “level of specificity” not matched by the professors’ lectures or assigned readings.

Students were also concerned by the “lack of collaboration” between Professors Jayawickreme and Schueller. While both professors showed a “passion for positive psychology” and “care for students,” one student commented that the lectures were “scattered” and “dumbed down.” Another suggested that the class would be “better as a seminar-style course” so that professors and students could “delve into the material with greater depth.”

Ultimately, students found the exams “nit-picky,” “extremely difficult,” and “poorly worded;” they also disliked the “overly technical” readings.

Students stated that they enjoyed this “stimulating” and “awesome” course. Some students complained of the superfluous readings, as one student was disappointed that “the textbook readings did not add anything outside &#8232;of the lecture”. However, the majority of students claimed that they had learned a considerable amount from the course and from Professor Goodwin’s “superb” lecture slides. &#8232;&#8232;

Students for the most part praised Professor Goodwin for his “interesting, engaging, and insightful” lectures. One student declared that “the room was always filled at 9AM”.

"This course explores the nervous and endocrine systems and how they work together to produce different physiological processes and behaviors in diverse vertebrate species. A wide range of topics are covered including sexual and parental behaviors, metabolism, stress, immunity, and mental health. While most of class time is dedicated to lectures, students are expected to participate in “Journal Clubs,” in which students write about and present primary literature. This, along with two exams, comprises the student’s final grade.

Many students reported learning a lot and found the subject matter interesting. Students liked how the course was geared toward “practical” skills, such as public speaking and analyzing primary literature, and appreciated that exams tested critical thinking more than rote memorization. However, some students complained there was not enough focus. Assigned readings were valued for being the most recent research out there, but many found the textbook superfluous and having little correspondence to the content covered in lecture.

Reviews of Professor Flanagan-Cato were generally positive. One student said she was “top notch in every way,” while others described her as sweet, “extremely friendly,” and “approachable.” Some thought she was very clear, but others thought her PowerPoint slides were “boring” and scattered. Everyone respected her as a “leading researcher” in the field and really felt she knew what she was doing. Many students felt they would have benefited greatly from having lecture recordings made available on Blackboard.

A background in biology is assumed, and Bibb109 or one year of biology are prerequisites. The course is highly recommend to majors but not recommended to non-majors. Although there is a lot of reading, most students enjoyed them greatly. As one student said, “[This course will] help me tremendously as a medical student.”",15391-401-1281-LORETTA-MARIE-FLANAGAN-CATO,LORETTA MARIE,1281-LORETTA-MARIE-FLANAGAN-CATO,FLANAGAN-CATO,LORETTA MARIE FLANAGAN-CATO,/instructor/1281-LORETTA-MARIE-FLANAGAN-CATO,45,48,/courses/15391/sections/401/reviews/1281-LORETTA-MARIE-FLANAGAN-CATO,2.58,2.60,2.58,2.91,2.90,2.73,1.88,3.16,1.50,2.26,,2.26,"['BIBB-260-401', 'PSYC-139-401']",15391-401,NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY,/courses/15391/sections/401,BIBB-260-401,401,2009A

"Psychology 001 introduces students to the basic topics of psychology. The course approaches to the understanding of the mind and behavior of humans and animals, placing emphasis on both the current state of knowledge and the process of discovery. Topics covered include brain and behavior, dreams and psychoanalysis, learning, sensation and perception, memory, thinking, appetite, and interpersonal relations. This course includes an in-class ""lab"" and focuses on critical thinking.

The course focuses on the practice of psychology rather than content, which students reported was interesting and thought provoking. Students also noted the analytical side of the course, which is beneficial beyond PSYC001. The classes were “entertaining”, “unbelievable”, and “enjoyable.” Several students said that the course taught lessons applicable to other schools, majors, and everyday life.

Professor Rozin received overwhelmingly good remarks from students enrolled in the course. He was described as “engaging”, “funny”, “inspiring”, “accessible,” and “charismatic”. However, many students complained that there was a disconnect between the lectures and the required reading. They also found that Prof. Rozin seemed disorganized at times and fond of random tangents. Still, students appreciated his enthusiasm and ability to make intro psychology an exciting course.

The course consists of open-note and open-book multiple-choice exams, yet many students insist that the tests were still very difficult. Several reported having to teach themselves the material from books. Although the topics and lectures were interesting, a popular reaction of students is that the material tested was not truly representative of the material covered in the course.

"The course, entitled “Learning”, focuses on changes in behavior resulting from past experience. The acquisition, maintenance, and elimination of behavior and the effects of previous experience on responses to new situations are explored.

Overall, the students highlighted the difficulty of the material. Some said it was the hardest course they had taken, but appreciated that the course challenged them immensely. “Although challenging, the rigor of the course brings a different type of knowledge to a student that is very beneficial for psychology or social science majors in particular.”

Many students believed that working with Professor Rescorla was “an absolute honor”, as he is a “legend in his field” and “a master within his field of research.” His knowledge, according to the students, was obvious and he made the lectures very engaging. However, several students complained that the lack of slides during lecture, the absence of a recitation, and the density of the readings, made it difficult to effectively study for the exams.

Lectures are essential to succeeding in the course. Review sessions were helpful for exams for the material was reported to be very dense and difficult to understand on one’s own. With the lack of lecture slides, visual learners may have a tougher time doing well on the exams.

"This course focuses on evaluating the experiments that have sought to establish links between brain structure (the activity of specific brain circuits) and behavioral function (the control of particular motivated and emotional behaviors). Students are exposed to concepts from regulatory physiology, systems neuroscience, pharmacology, and endocrinology, and read textbook as well as original source materials. The course focuses on the following behaviors: feeding, sex, fear, anxiety, the appetite for salt, and food aversion. The course also considers the neuro-chemical control of responses with an eye towards evaluating the development of drug treatments for: obesity, anorexia/cachexia, vomiting, sexual dysfunction, anxiety disorders, and depression.

Most students thought that the class was very difficult, disorganized, and frustrating. While some students were able to get through dense readings from psychology papers, most students found the course to be very challenging and not very interesting.

Professor Grill received mixed reviews for his teaching style. Some students described Professor Grill as very disorganized and unable to explain concepts simply. They claimed that his lectures were somewhat “erratic”. Other students appreciated his slow and methodical explanations, insisting that “his teaching style actually helps (the student) take in the complex material.”

While the material and topics were interesting to students, several reported that the grading of exams was unfair and difficult. The essays required lengthy answers, but time constraints limited students’ ability to answer them appropriately. The lack of explanation about the grading system made it difficult for students to gauge their level in the class. The class was recommended for majors and students maintain that “this is a great class for anyone who enjoys linking physiological (specifically neurological) structure to function.” PSYC 001 is a prerequisite for this course.

"The course, Animal Behavior, teaches the evolution of social behavior in animals, with special emphasis on group formation, cooperation among kin, mating systems, territoriality, and communication.

The course received great reviews from students interested in both the psychological and the biological aspects of the material. Students described it as “extremely interesting”, “fun”, and “fascinating.” The material was very clear, well presented, and informative and the course exceeded the expectations of many.

Professor White also received very positive remarks from the students. The vast majority believed he was a great lecturer and made an “already interesting subject even more engaging for his students.” Accolades such as “amazing”, “fabulous”, and “terrific” dotted the students’ responses.

Students with various backgrounds – biology, psychology, and other majors – responded that they were able to learn very much from this course. The course consisted of quizzes and three exams (no final) and these were all described as fair and straightforward.

"This course describes the nature of human language, how it is used to speak and comprehend, and how it is learned. The course raises and discusses issues such as whether language ability is innate and unique to humans, whether there is a critical period for the acquisition of a language, and how linguistic and conceptual knowledge interact.

Overall, students greatly enjoyed this class, citing its “fascinating subject” and coverage of “lots of interesting material.” Students reported learning a lot from this course, claiming that the “readings are very interesting and relevant to the course, and there is just the right number of them.”

Students spoke highly of Professor Dahan. They said she was “excellent,” approachable, “cared a lot about how students were doing,” and was “very helpful in answering questions.” They appreciated her “enthusiasm” and said that Professor Dahan “provokes interest in the subject.” Some students also praised her presentation skills, citing the helpfulness of her slides for visual learners since they incorporated arrows, graphs, and videos. Professor Dahan provided a very comprehensive syllabus, and her “BlackBoard site was perfect.”

The workload was not tough but several students were unimpressed by the exams. These exams were open note, but some students wished they were “closed-book but unambiguous.” Students felt that Professor Dahan was “liberal with trick questions” that were generally “easy to spot.” Students recommend this course for majors and non-majors alike, stressing that cognitive science majors especially will “probably find it interesting.” Some students commented that while it is not impossible to get an ‘A’, most grades seemed to be distributed around a ‘B’.

Some students said that the material was interesting but the lectures can “get a bit boring.” Though these lectures were “clear” and “cohesive,” students felt that too much time was spent on “relatively simple concepts.”

Overall, students liked Professor Trueswell. They found him to be approachable, “prepared,” and “an all-around nice guy who wants us to learn.” Some students called him “engaging” but others considered his “straight lecture” style “boring.” Several students commended the way the course was taught, but some also felt he could motivate students more.

Students stated that the material was “interesting” and praised the book, which was written by Professor Baron himself. Some students, however, expressed dissatisfaction with the poor structure of the course. They believed that the lectures were not engaging and noted that many students did not show up to lecture.

Most students felt that Professor Baron needed to be more approachable and that “he has trouble getting [ideas] across.” Although students noted his accomplishments in research and great intelligence, they found Professor Baron to be disorganized and complained that he “didn’t understand what it’s like to be a student learning.” Several students stated that they learned very little in class. They were put off by Prof. Baron's demeanor and occasionally terse responses to questions.

Students did not recommend this course for their fellow students for they did not believe that it was very valuable. Some considered it “punishment” for PPE majors.

Many students found the tests to be unfair, “ambiguous,” and “nit-picking,” focusing on memorization of “almost silly details” as opposed to understanding of material. A few students commented that they would have enjoyed the course more were it not for the difficult multiple-choice exams.

"This course aims to provide a general background in the study of neuroscience, covering the cellular, sensory, and higher cognitive levels. The main text is Bear's Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain, which many students said was extremely helpful. This course fulfills the Living World Sector requirement for Arts and Sciences students.

Most students rated the course as interesting, and one in which they “learned a lot,” especially in the second half of the course. Other students noted how the material was “relevant and important.” Students disagreed about whether or not the topics should have been dealt with in greater depth: although some felt there should have been more detail covered, others felt that there was already too much material.

Students generally had a positive impression of Professor Medina, citing his “connection with the students” and his ability to make material “engaging and comprehensible.” One senior went so far as to describe him as “one of the best lecturers I've had at Penn.” If students had one main criticism of Prof. Medina, it was that he encouraged competition that was “not conducive to learning.”&#8232;

Most students were BIBB majors or minors, though with a range of prior knowledge. Some noted that some non-majors dropped after the first exam, making the curve harder for everyone else. Most students did not find the material itself difficult, but complained about the exams, which were more abstract than reflective of readings and lectures and were longer than there was time for, turning each into a “test of endurance.” Workload, however, was fairly light, consisting mostly of reading. Students who wanted study aids found reviewing the slides and lecture recordings on Blackboard particularly useful, though they also stated that material was “not hard to follow” if you attended lectures.",17013-401-4262-JAVIER-F--MEDINA,JAVIER F.,4262-JAVIER-F--MEDINA,MEDINA,JAVIER F.

"This course surveys a wide range of answers to this question from disciplines ranging from philosophy to neuroscience. The course devotes special attention to the use of simple computational and mathematical models. Topics include perception, learning, memory, decision making, emotion and consciousness.

This interdisciplinary course covers a ""broad spectrum of topics,"" and is considered thought-provoking and interesting. The class reportedly covered many concepts with an “appropriate level of detail” and was considered a great introduction to cognitive science. Students found this class somewhat disorganized and scattered, with no textbook and multiple professors and TAs. The course lacked ""synthesis"" and ""cohesiveness.""

Professor Ungar is ""very good at explaining things,"" but sometimes ""speaks at lengths about one topic for too long."" The class sometimes lost direction when one of the two professors accepted questions from the class, then went off on various tangents. Students did appreciate the high level of class involvement, which took place primarily in the form of experiments and class polls.

Homework ""rarely involved reasoning of the concepts covered in class."" Some students found the required readings irrelevant and unimportant to the content and flow of the course. Additionally, students occasionally had trouble with the math involved in the curriculum.

"The course introduces students to the problems and characteristic concepts of cognitive science, drawing on formal and empirical approaches from the disciplines of computer science, linguistics, neuroscience, philosophy, and psychology. Topics covered include perception, action, learning, language, knowledge representation, and inference. This course fulfills the “formal reasoning and analysis” requirement.

Students generally found the course to be “interesting” with the broad range of topics covered in different perspectives. However, they indicated the co-teaching from both professors caused the course to lack coherence. Some students called for the need of central text and more focus on key ideas. Despite its lack of clarity, one student commented that the review sessions helped organize and place the topics into context.

Professor Brainard was praised as “engaging” and “easy to listen to.” However, students pointed out that sometimes his slides have no writing, which could be confusing for materials not covered in class. 

Readings could be time consuming. Prerequisites include an introductory course in computer science, linguistics, neuroscience, philosophy, or PSYC 001. It is a requirement for major and minor in cognitive science and recommended for students pursuing a dual degree in computer and cognitive science. It is also recommended for non-majors who want to learn about an unfamiliar topic.

"This course explores some of the major topics in psychology including how we receive and interpret information from the world, learning and motivation, the relationship between brain and behavior, development, personality (both normal and abnormal), and the social aspects of our behavior. The major controversies in psychology provide the binding themes in the course, such as nature versus nurture and theories about the relationship between mind and body. It examines some of the grand questions that psychologists have posed and investigated: what forces shape our behavior, who do we love and why, what is prejudice and who conforms, and do we think and behave rationally. These issues are examined at several levels of explanation, from neurotransmitter functioning, through conditioning, and the influence of the group. 

Most students found the class to be “interesting” and “fantastic.” The slideshows were “well-prepared” and “engaging.” Some students said this was their favorite class at Penn and their favorite class of the semester. One student complained about the mandatory research requirement where students are expected to partake in a specified amount of psychological experiments being conducted at the university. Another student felt that the exams “were intended to trick the students, rather than test acquired knowledge.”

Students adored Professor Grant. Many complimented his teaching style, saying that he was very “engaging, encouraging, down-to-earth, charismatic, and a great lecturer who gave clear explanations.” A student felt that Professor Grant was very accessible and gave a lot of extra help. Above all Professor Grant was applauded for his humor. There was overwhelming consensus that Professor Grant was “fun and funny.” One student said that he “looked forward to the professor’s jokes every week.” Other students claimed that the professor was their “idol” and “the man.” Not a single critique was made.

"This course tries to answer how individuals acquire knowledge and are guided by their perceptions of objects and events in their environment. 

Overall, students reported learning a lot in this class, finding the information “interesting” and applicable to other subjects including: art, marketing, design, and philosophy.  Primary complaints about the course were that there was too much information covered, the class moved too quickly, and lectures were very reminiscent of the assigned textbook readings.  

Students described Professor Allred as “very nice and incredibly approachable.”  While many agreed that the professor was a good communicator, most criticized the professor for reading directly from the slides and explaining little more than was covered in the text.  Students also commented that the professor moved too quickly through the more challenging material of the course.

"This course covers the neural systems that underlie human perception, memory and language. It also addresses the pathological syndromes that result from damage to these systems.

Students frequently used the same two words to describe this cognitive neuroscience course: “interesting” and “difficult.” Most students applauded the subject matter and structure of the course. The course was designed with “a focus on the importance of material to our world and not its relevance to the exam.” The difficulty of the material presented a considerable—but, “if you put in enough effort,” a surmountable—challenge to students as well. The fact that there were no small, periodic assignments on material presented in class to help reinforce concepts was distressing to some students.

Professor Epstein’s sense humor and passion for the material made the material much more digestible. His use of “helpful” video clips to demonstrate particular cognitive disorders was also much appreciated by his students. However, they critiqued the pacing of the lectures and the class, saying that some sections of the course were “rushed” and that a little too much time was spent on perception, the professor’s area of expertise. Students also complained that the course often had more breadth than depth, citing the fact that too many experiments were presented in lecture without adequate explanation. In general, however, most students characterized the class as a “positive intellectual experience” and characterized Professor Epstein as a “great professor.” 

This course fulfills the Living World Sector. It is cross-listed under psychology and biology. Some psychology students in the course reported a concern about their ability to do well in the class: one student wrote “one of my favorite psych lecture courses in all 4 years here, but definitely challenging.” Some biology-focused students were not satisfied with the organization or approach of the class.",20751-401-2317-RUSSELL-ALAN-EPSTEIN,RUSSELL ALAN,2317-RUSSELL-ALAN-EPSTEIN,EPSTEIN,RUSSELL ALAN EPSTEIN,/instructor/2317-RUSSELL-ALAN-EPSTEIN,50,72,/courses/20751/sections/401/reviews/2317-RUSSELL-ALAN-EPSTEIN,3.14,3.00,3.04,2.82,3.23,3.16,2.44,3.49,2.04,2.78,,2.30,"['PSYC-149-401', 'BIBB-249-401']",20751-401,COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE,/courses/20751/sections/401,PSYC-149-401,401,2008A

"This course provides an overview of the various psychological disorders. Specifically, course objectives include: (a) examine historical and current conceptions of normal and abnormal behavior; (b) survey the symptoms and characteristics of several adult psychological disorders (including mood disorders, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and eating disorders); (c) explore theory and research on the origins of these disorders; and d) introduce the main treatment approaches for these disorders.

Overall, students enjoyed the class and found the material to be both interesting and relevant to daily life. One student claimed that this class “goes on to paint an extremely clear picture of psychopathology!” 

Students appreciated Professor Ruscio’s organization, communication skills and passion for her subject. The majority of the class felt that she was “very enthusiastic and committed to the class.” One student declared that “students respect Professor Ruscio and she is able to stimulate much interest. She is a great professor and this is a great class.” Another raved that he was “impressed by not only her organization but by her great compassion. If only all of Penn’s professors could be like her!” The majority of students were also happy with Professor Ruscio’s utilization of video clips to help them “see” what each mental disorder looks like in the real world. 

While some students complained that “the assignments felt like busy work,” most felt like the work and readings were excellent supplements to the material covered in lectures. The only prerequisite for the course is Psyc 001, Introduction to Experimental Psychology. Students highly recommended this class for all psychology majors and others suggested that any student interested in the field, regardless of major, should enroll in this course.",20754-001-4208-AYELET-MERON-RUSCIO,AYELET MERON,4208-AYELET-MERON-RUSCIO,RUSCIO,AYELET MERON RUSCIO,/instructor/4208-AYELET-MERON-RUSCIO,86,110,/courses/20754/sections/1/reviews/4208-AYELET-MERON-RUSCIO,3.18,3.53,3.19,2.47,3.38,3.44,2.64,3.55,2.77,3.10,,2.35,['PSYC-162-001'],20754-001,ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY,/courses/20754/sections/1,PSYC-162-001,001,2008A

"Human Sexuality covers topics ranging from the anatomy and physiology of the human reproductive system to the cognitive systems that underpin human sexual behavior. Throughout, there is an emphasis on the relationship between the features of these physical and cognitive mechanisms and the evolutionary functions these systems were designed to serve.

Students loved this course, with many calling it “one of my favorites at Penn.” They found the content interesting and appreciated that Professor Kurzban related the course material to current events.  Students reported learning a lot and one commented that she will “actually remember a good amount of the material unlike other classes.” Students also noted that the class was well organized and the slides were a great study tool.	

Professor Kurzban was very popular among students, who called him “amazing” and “engaging.” Students enjoyed Professor Kurzban’s sense of humor, saying that he was “always animated and made lots of jokes.” Another student noted that despite the 9am start time,  “I always wanted to come to class because he made it so fun to learn the material.”

Students found the exams fairly difficult. The multiple choice questions were very specific and “material not explicitly covered in class was on exam.” PSYC001 is a prerequisite for this course and the course fulfills the Society sector requirement.",20755-001-1946-ROBERT-O-KURZBAN,ROBERT O,1946-ROBERT-O-KURZBAN,KURZBAN,ROBERT O KURZBAN,/instructor/1946-ROBERT-O-KURZBAN,37,51,/courses/20755/sections/1/reviews/1946-ROBERT-O-KURZBAN,2.85,3.27,2.85,2.65,3.24,3.18,2.53,3.47,2.68,3.18,,1.97,['PSYC-168-001'],20755-001,HUMAN SEXUALITY,/courses/20755/sections/1,PSYC-168-001,001,2008A
"An introductory study of theories and research across the range of social behavior from intra-individual to the group level including the effects of culture, social environment, and groups on social interaction. Topics include social influence, conformity and obedience, persuasion, aggression and conflict, altruism, stereotypes and prejudice, interpersonal attraction, and the self-concept.

Students enjoyed this course and found the subject matter to be very interesting. One student commented that this is a “great course that is useful in everyday life!” Others praised the interesting, real-life examples that were included in lectures.  

Students found Professor Siev to be very engaging and were impressed with how much discussion there was considering the size of the class. One student noted that “Professor Siev was a really great professor. He was very illustrative of the material and you could tell that he really cared about the students and whether we understood what was going on or not.” However there were some who commented that Professor Siev’s lectures were a bit too repetitive of the textbook material. 

The course fulfills the Society Sector requirement and the only prerequisite for the course is Psyc 001, Introduction to Experimental Psychology. Students recommended this class to psychology majors and non-majors and did not feel like there was much work required for the course.

"Cognitive Development teaches students about what infants and young children come to know about the world, and how they learn it. Topics included changes in children\'s thinking, perceptual development, language acquisition, and some current theories of how cognitive development occurs.

The course was described as “very worthwhile,” and as containing “very useful and practical info.” “The things I learned in this class will no doubt help me for the rest of my life,” one student wrote. Another said, it “sparked my interest in this area of psychology.”

Student responders unanimously agreed that Professor Swingley was an “amazing,” “fantastic,” “enthusiastic” professor. “The best psych professor at Penn!” several said. “Great personality, presence, presentation” one student summarized. Students also enjoyed the way he constructed his lectures and the slides: “I loved the way he presented research findings in every class rather than simply spewing unfounded fact.” They appreciated his use of videos to explain concepts and research techniques. Professor Swingley was also described as unusually accessible, taking time to thoroughly answer students’ questions and “grant generous extensions” on assignments when students needed them.

A few students complained that the midterms did not contain enough questions to assess their knowledge of material.

"Community Psychology teaches more of an approach to the use of psychology rather than a separate sub-field or discipline. Whereas traditional psychology focuses on the individual as the subject of study and intervention, the community approach takes into consideration the interaction between the individual and the environment. Additionally, where traditional approaches to psychology typically deal with individuals’ existing problems (i.e., the medical model), community psychology allows for proactive strategies of treatment, such as programs for prevention and awareness. This course gave an overview of the methodology, theory, and application of the community psychology perspective with a focus on its application to the mental health field.

Most students did not comment on the quality of the course, although the few that did mentioned that the subject matter seemed more interesting than the class was actually able to convey. “It seems like for a lot of what we have learned is that there are no real answers consensus,” one student mused. Several students mentioned that more “field trips” and “hands on interaction” with the material would make the class more exciting and the material more accessible.

Professor Jameson used a teaching method in which he asked students to send in questions about their assigned reading, and then used these questions to structure the information he discussed during class. However, students did completely buy into this unusual idea, some even going so far as to say that it was “pretty disappointing.” Others gave the method credit, saying it was “a useful way to generate class discussions.” One student did acknowledge that the discussions were “a bit slow,” “repetitive,” and too unstructured for really learning the material.

"This class focuses on the analysis of many mental processes in adult humans such as attention, pattern recognition, imagery, memory, action, and mental architecture. Although it is not required at registration, a recitation is required for the class and several choices of days/times is announced on the first day of class. This class reviews the current scientific understanding of human cognition. Cognition refers to the mental activities that support knowing about the world, including perception, memory, reasoning, decision-making and language. Scientific theories of human cognition are based primarily on the results of experimental investigations into human behavior and its neural correlates. Throughout the course, students will review these results in hopes of gaining better insight into how humans think, perceive and communicate.&#8232;&#8232;This course is an extension of the cognitive psychology portion taught in Psychology 001. Students are required to participate in experiments to help deepen their understanding and show an example of the different processes that go on within our minds. Students overall praised the organization of the course and the obvious amount of planning that went into every lecture.&#8232;&#8232;Professor Trueswell was both praised and critiqued for his lectures in this course. Though students said that he used Power Point effectively and did his best to keep students engaged throughout the class period, others found lectures to be a bit dry. Though the material was difficult and sometimes required remembering a lot of details, he spoke clearly and carefully, making sure that all students were following along. &#8232;&#8232;Overall, students found that the tests and homework did not run parallel to the coursework. Homework was thought to be graded inconsistently and tests seemed to be intentionally tricky, especially the multiple choice. Many took this course to fulfill a requirement within the major, and would only recommend it for others trying to do the same. Psychology 001 is a prerequisite, so only those pursuing psychology are advised to register for this course.",22345-001-1023-JOHN-C--TRUESWELL,JOHN C.,1023-JOHN-C--TRUESWELL,TRUESWELL,JOHN C.

"This course introduces students to the psychology of personality and individual differences in humans. This course attempts to answer the question: “How are people different from one another?” Taking a multi-dimensional approach to individual differences, this course seeks to integrate biological, cognitive-experimental, and socio-cultural influences on personality.&#8232;&#8232;Students found the course material to be unclear. Some students thought that, “the subject matter was often too complex.” Due to the ambiguity of the material, “students were unsure of what to study” before exams.&#8232;&#8232;Students expressed serious concern about the professor’s beliefs in outdated theories and seeming disregard for the goals of the course. &#8232;This course is not listed as fulfilling any major college requirements.

"This course is an introduction to the scientific study of human memory, with a particular emphasis on the interplay between theory and experiment. Topics include dual store models and the debate over short-term memory, recognition memory for items and associations, the role of time and context in memory formation and retrieval, theories of association, memory for sequences, the influence of prior knowledge on new learning, spatial and navigational memory, perceptual learning, classification and function learning, memory disorders, and developmental changes in memory function. &#8232;&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;Students generally found the subject matter of this course “interesting,” with one student describing the material and concepts as “captivating.” The course involves three Excel-based projects. &#8232;&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;Students held mixed opinions of Dr. Kahana. While some described him as a “great lecturer” and another even as “a phenomenal asset to our institution,” others found that he relied too heavily on the textbook to instruct students rather than teaching himself. One student noted that Dr. Kahana was “more than willing to meet with students,” while another complained that he was “unwilling to make scheduling exceptions for students.” Another student commented that Dr. Kahana was unaware of the unrealistic demands he made of students concerning their assignments. Most agreed that he was very “intelligent.”&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;Prerequisites for this course are Math 104 and Psychology 001. Many students commented that efficiency in Excel should be a prerequisite for this class, as well.

"An Introduction to Brain and Behavior, this class provides basic coverage of the structure and function of the vertebrate nervous system. The class begins with a description of the cellular basis of neuronal activities and then moves to a discussion of the physiological bases of motor control, sensory systems, motivated behaviors, and higher mental processes. The course is primarily targeted to students interested in neurobiology of behavior, including animal behaviors and clinical disorders.

Most students seemed to enjoy the class and felt that they had learned about the brain from a detailed “chemical, biological, and anatomical point of view.” Although students felt they picked up on the basic concepts, many expressed frustration over there being “tons of information” and too many “minute details,” which were difficult to remember throughout the course.

Professor Muzzio overall received fairly positive reviews. Besides a few complaints on her ability to cover the comprehensive amount of course material, most students described her as “engaging,” “passionate” and able to “communicate material very clearly especially considering [its] complexity.” Students appreciated that she “emphasized understanding instead of memorization.” Many were also impressed by her ability to make a complex and information-heavy subject stimulating. There was a wide range of comments concerning Professor Muzzio’s accessibility: some felt that she was willing and always available during office hours, while others thought that she could be impatient.

Students enrolled in this class ranged from BIBB majors to psychology majors attempting to fulfill their neural requirement, as well as students fulfilling the Living World Sector. Students should expect three midterms. The large volume of information was the largest contribution to the difficult workload.

"BIBB-270 begins with a review of basic concepts in pharmacology, including routes of drug administration, drug metabolism, the dose response curve, tolerance, and sensitization. Following a brief overview of cellular foundations of neuropharmacology (cell biology, synaptic and receptor function), the course will focus on various classes of drugs used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, schizophrenia and anxiety. It will additionally consider mechanisms mediating the mind-altering, addictive and neurotoxic effects of abused drugs. BIBB-109 is a prerequisite.

Students described BIBB-270 as “one of the most interesting courses at Penn” and “informative.” Students also felt that the course was “manageable” for students without a strong background in biology. In general, they liked the inclusion of group exercises; however, many felt that the three-hour lecture format made it “hard to concentrate.”

Students had mixed reviews of Professor Zach. While many students described her as “very enthusiastic and sincere” as well as “extremely helpful,” others felt that Professor Zach was unable to simulate students’ interest in the course material, even though the material itself was interesting. Several students were also concerned that Professor Zach was “disorganized” and tended to have mistakes in her lecture slides and exam questions.

The exams for this class are based on the information in the textbook, which was described as “very dense.” Students complained that the lecture material did not always correlate with the textbook and that the exam questions were often “hard to understand.”

"PAn introductory class, this class explores the major topics in psychology, including the relationship between brain and behavior, how we receive and interpret information from the world, learning and motivation, development, personality (both normal and abnormal), and the social aspects of our behavior. The major controversies in psychology constitute the binding themes in the course, such as nature versus nurture and theories about the relationship between mind and body. The “grand” questions that psychologists have posed and investigated are covered, including what forces shape our behavior, who do we love and why, what is prejudice and who conforms, and do we think and behave rationally. These issues are examined at several levels of explanation, from neurotransmitter functioning, through conditioning and the influence of the group. The history of psychology is also explored, from the Greeks to the neuropsychological and pharmaceutical revolutions of today. This course is the prerequisite for Psychology courses numbered 100 and above, and it fulfills the Living World Sector requirement.

Students were divided about how engaging the course material was. Many reported that the material was “interesting” and that the PowerPoints were “intriguing” because the professor “integrated many great references, short videos, and pictures that went extremely well with the material.” Others felt that the material could often seem “a little dull or complicated,” especially since the class is an overview and does not go into depth about most topics. Nearly all students commented that going to lecture was often unnecessary because the lecture content mirrored the textbook content, and all of Professor Chrysikou’s PowerPoints were posted on Blackboard. 

Students praised Professor Chrysikou immensely for her accessibility and kindness. Even though there was no recitation, students commented that Professor Chrysikou and the TA’s made themselves very available to students. Students further described Chrysikou as “sweet,” “helpful,” and “nice” and complimented her for showing a genuine interest in each student despite the large size of the class. Other students commended the professor’s passion and professionalism. A few students commented that her accent could be difficult to understand at times.

Many of the students in this class were fulfilling a sector requirement, and they found this course an easy and enjoyable way to do so. Students noted that Professor Chrysikou’s grading system made it nearly impossible to get lower than a B, and most reported that they expected to receive A’s. Professor Chrysikou offered substantial extra credit, dropped the lowest midterm, and did not give a final. This class was recommended highly to both majors and non-majors as a way to fulfill a requirement, earn a high grade, and get a brief overview of psychology.

"This class seeks to explore how the individual acquires and is guided by knowledge about objects and events in their environment. Integral questions for the course include: Why do things sound, look, and feel the way they do? What do our senses tell us about reality? How can we measure our perceptual abilities, and what do our measurements tell us? Linking hypotheses: how do we relate what happens in the world to physiology in the brain and to our phenomenal perception?

Students found this course “challenging,” but the content to be interesting. It was said to lean heavily on physics and math, which students were not prepared for. Many students found this class to be “one of their worst.”

Professor Stocker is called “knowledgeable” and “accessible,” but his lectures are described as “unclear” and taken straight from the textbook.

Some found that because of his depth of knowledge his lectures were at times “difficult to follow,” though many also praised his ability to clearly explain the information. Students found him to be a very demanding professor who did not hold back from criticizing both students and other branches of psychology. While he did not hold office hours, he did have lunch once a week with students in order to answer general questions.

One student found that “while the amount of material is not overwhelming, experiment design, one of the focuses of this course, is not easy.” However, most students agreed that the material was extremely difficult and that it required “extensive reading and outside of class work.” Some students were unclear about what would be on the exams and many students found that the grading standards were extremely high. Students recommended this course for majors or students who want to go into research. The only prerequisite for this course is PSYC 001.

"This course focuses on evaluating the experiments that have sought to establish links between brain structure and behavioral function. Students are exposed to concepts from regulatory physiology, systems neuroscience, pharmacology, and endocrinology. Students read from the textbook but are also assigned original source materials. The course focuses on the following behaviors: feeding, sex, fear, anxiety, the appetite for salt, and food aversion. The course also considers the neurochemical control of responses with an eye towards evaluating the development of drug treatments for: obesity, anorexia/cachexia, vomiting, sexual dysfunction, anxiety disorders, and depression.

Students for the most part found the class somewhat dull.

Students generally criticized Professor Grill’s disorganized lectures. Several commented on his inaccessibility to meet outside of class. Despite these comments, other students also mentioned that he was “knowledgeable on the subject matter” and that he was “smart and funny.”

Many of the students taking this class were taking it for their major or minor, and the majority of students would only recommend taking it for this reason. One student in particular recommended it for those interested in Biological Basis of Behavior. Many students found the subject too challenging for a 100-level course.

"This course will provide an introduction to the major areas of the study of animal behavior with attention to evolution and ecology. The course will study the diversity of behavior across animals of many taxa and give special focus to social interactions, mating, and communication. The main texts are Animal Behavior: An evolutionary Approach by Alcock and Exploring Animal Behavior by Sherman and Alcock. There are three midterms and no finals. 

Students enjoyed the readings in this course and the additional readings were “for the most part beneficial.” Most of the students enjoyed the content covered in the class but said that it was too “one-sided,” mostly focusing on birds and primates. 

A large number of students praised Professor White for his ability to make the topic interesting. He is “fantastic” and “hilarious,” often incorporating videos to demonstrate concepts. Some students described Professor White as their favorite teacher at Penn and the course as their best course of the semester. On the other hand, students also thought Professor White could spend his lectures “more wisely and efficiently”, as he spends too much times going over examples. 

Almost all of the students think the midterms and quizzes were “incredibly difficult” and “very poorly written”. Grading is inconsistent and often contains “ambiguous open questions” that were not mentioned in class. Students coming into this course expected easier exams and were surprised by their difficulty.

"PSYC 149 integrates psychology and neuroscience. The course will explore the neural systems that underlie human perception, memory, and language, and the pathological syndromes that result from damage to these systems.

This course places emphasis on experiments in the field of neuroscience and in the interpretation of data. Students found this course interesting and many students reported learning a lot. However, one student reported that there is a great deal of overlap between this course and PSYC 111 and BBB 109.

Students reported that Professor Epstein is a very enthusiastic and clear lecturer. His slides are well-organized and useful in preparing for exams. Additionally, Professor Epstein attempts to inject humor into his lectures. However, some students complained that Professor Epstein was disorganized in terms of returning papers and exams and in providing students with a grading rubric.

Students reported that exams for this course were fair, and emphasized that students should attend lectures to be successful. Additionally, Professor Epstein provided review sheets before each exam, which were invaluable in preparing for the tests. One student wrote that exams focused on the students’ ability to understand the material beyond a simply factual level. Additionally, one student commented that psychology majors were at a disadvantage compared to BBB majors in terms of previously-learned material.

"This course investigates standards of thinking, judgment, and deciding, while detailing the various ways people fall short of these standards. The course addresses both personal and societal decision making, with emphasis placed on fallacies and biases of the people and processes that lead to a decision. Course readings include Professor Baron’s own textbook entitled “Thinking and Deciding,” as well as selections from The New York Times, professional academic journals, and various other sources. This course meets requirements towards the Psychology major, and may optionally be used towards a PPE major or a Consumer Psychology minor. This course does not, however, emphasize applications to consumer psychology. While this course satisfies the quantitative data analysis requirement of the College, Professor Baron requests students consider other ways to satisfy the requirement.

Students reacted to the course content with mixed opinions. Some students found the material “very interesting” and praised the “variation in types of assignments.” Nevertheless, most students felt that “the material for this course was extremely dense.” Many students criticized the “very difficult concepts and difficult grading” in the course. Several students noted how the course suffered from “a great deal of repetition” in reading and lecture content.

While several students described Professor Baron as “very knowledgeable in his field and an excellent researcher,” the overwhelming majority of students criticized his teaching. Most students commented that Professor Baron failed to “stimulate class interest,” made it difficult to “follow his train of thought,” and did not “take the time to explain complex subject matters” in class. 

Students cautioned others from taking this course unless required. Most students felt unsure about their grades and the general grading system. Students felt the course “had a lot of potential” and the course would benefit from much restructuring, but would not recommend the course to others.

"This course provides an introduction to the psychology of personality and individual differences. The class primarily focuses on the question: “How are people different from each other?” It highlights research that take a multidimensional approach to individual differences and attempts to integrate across the biological, cognitive-experimental, and social-cultural influences on personality.

Overall, students described this class as “excellent” and “interesting.” Several found that they would have benefited from more information on the individual lecture slides, but in general, the lectures were organized and informative.

Students called Professor Kable a “stimulating lecturer.” One in particular liked that he was “good at keeping students engaged.” Another student noted his “encouragement of class participation.” Many appreciated how straightforward Professor Kable was with the requirements of the course.

Most students who took this course were doing it for their major or minor. One in particular said that he would not recommend it to a non-major. The course is challenging; and one student remarked that it was too hard for a 100-level course.

"This course introduces the study of positive psychology. Topics include positive emotions, positive character traits, and positive institutions, with emphasis placed on describing these aspects of positive psychology and how they can be applied to both individuals and communities.

Students found the course content both challenging and rewarding. Some students praised the “engaging material” and “stimulating discussion” of the course. Others noted that the course encouraged introspection and that “you learn a lot about yourself through this class.” Students seemed content with the course material and readings, and several noted how lessons learned in class could be applied to daily life.

Students praised Professor Doshi’s presence in the classroom. Many students described professor Doshi as “a fantastic instructor,” who proved “approachable, friendly, [and] encouraging.” Students lauded the small setting which allowed Professor Doshi to ensure that “every student gets involved.”

Students described feeling like they had “gained personal insights” from the course. Many described the course as “very challenging” but “worthwhile.”

PSYC 180 provides developmental perspective on the general empirical and theoretical psychology of social and emotional development over the lifespan. The course emphasizes the application of basic science to real-world contexts.

This course covers a wide range of materials. Students felt that they learned a lot, but that classes were rushed, due to the large amount of information crammed into each one. Additionally, some students stated that the topics covered in this course were only vaguely linked to each other.

Most students found Professor Hafetz to be knowledgeable and organized in her presentation of the material. Additionally, many reported that she is nice and accommodating; she makes an effort to schedule appointments with students outside of class time and to respond promptly to emails. However, many students felt that Professor Hafetz rushed through the lecture slides and dismissed her classes early. Students felt that this made taking notes and staying focused in class very difficult. Professor Hafetz also mainly read off of her slides.

While there is not a lot of work required for this course for the majority of the semester, students reported that the third midterm and the final exam were lengthy take-home tests. The midterm was 16 pages long to be done in a week and the final was 12 pages long to be done in two weeks. Nevertheless, most students did not feel that the tests were too difficult. One student commented, however, that preparing for exams was challenging due to the wide range of material.

A majority of students were disappointed by the lack of organization and poor correspondence between lecture and readings in this course. Many students thought that the course would benefit from “less material” and more coherent discussion of each topic. While several students praised the mini-course option for providing a small environment to study a particular topic in-depth, many felt that the course overall lacked cohesion between the general topics discussed in class and the specificity of questions on exams.

Students were polarized in their opinions of Professor Rozin’s lecturing ability. Roughly half of the students suggested that Professor Rozin “obviously knows the course materials, but does not know how to communicate it on an introductory level.” The other half of students described Professor Rozin as “engaging,” but stated “the size of the class really diminishes the learning experience.” Many students were pleased, however, that Professor Rozin was quick to respond to emails and willing to discuss issues with students.

Many students in this class were not Psychology majors, and instead took the course to fulfill the Living World sector requirement. The vast majority of students took issue with the examinations for this course. Many students argued that the online testing system “encouraged cheating” and the tests “were extremely hard because of tricky or unfairly phrased questions.”  Many students were reluctant to recommend this class to others.

Most students seemed to enjoy this “informative and exciting” course, despite it’s three-hour time slot. While some found the length of the class to be daunting, most students believed the interesting course content was sufficient to keep them focused for the entire class. The material was straightforward, interesting, and relevant to everyday life. Students expressed a desire that the three-hour class be broken up by some more multimedia presentations, such as related videos.

Professor Gehrman received very positive reviews, with students saying that he was “fun, fair, approachable” and “able to hold the class’ attention for three hours.” While some students remarked that he was “slightly disorganized,” for the most part, students expressed that he was “accommodating and energetic.”

Students felt the tests for this class were sometimes “ambiguous” and the questions were vague, but in general they felt the coursework was very manageable. Students would recommend this course to anyone.

"Psychology 111 focuses highly on how we interact with our world in daily life. It focuses on how the individual acquires and is guided by knowledge about objects and events in their environment. The course is heavily science based, though tries to make the material as manageable as possible. It applies to both the psychology major and minor, as well as visual studies majors and minors.  

In general students found this course exciting and stimulating. Many agreed that the material, as well as the layout of the course, was “enjoyable” and “interesting.” It was viewed overall as an “excellent” class. One student raved about the applicability of the course to everyday life because of its attention to the interaction between mind and mathematics. It was one student’s “favorite psychology class taken at Penn.” 

Professor Stocker was well liked and respected by students. He was very accessible outside of class and was incredibly helpful during office hours. He gives small assignments each week to keep students on track, but students complained that Professor Stocker never posts answers online. Overall, Professor Stocker was viewed as kind, engaging, and able to stimulate interest in the material, which helped students stay motivated in class throughout the semester. 

This class comes recommended almost unanimously. The workload was reported to be small and the grading forgiving. The only prerequisite is PSYC 001.

"Psychology 127 focused on evaluating the experiments that have sought to establish links between brain structure (the activity of specific brain circuits) and behavioral function (the control of particular motivated and emotional behaviors).  Students will be exposed to concepts from regulatory physiology, systems neuroscience, pharmacology, and endocrinology and read textbook as well as original source materials. The course focuses on the following behaviors: feeding, sex, fear, anxiety, the appetite for salt, and food aversion.  The course also considered the neurochemical control of responses with an eye towards evaluating the development of drug treatments for: obesity, anorexia/cachexia, vomiting, sexual dysfunction, anxiety disorders, and depression.
Overall students were disappointed with this course. The readings were hard to understand and the course material was strongly biology-based. However, one student reported that the class was both “interesting” and “challenging.”
Students were generally displeased with Professor Grill. While they complimented his intelligence, they criticized his ability to properly communicate material and his lack of availability for students. However, a vast majority of students heaped praise on their TA. 
This course is not recommended to non-majors. In fact, many students wished that there had been a prerequisite of Biology or Brain and Behavior because the course was so challenging without that biology background.

Psychology 160 explores the psychology of personality and individual differences with respect to the question, “how are people different from each other?” The course will explore this issue from a multidimensional approach integrating biological, cognitive-experimental, and social-cultural influences on differences between individuals. 

Many students considered the material covered in this course “interesting,” but occasionally “dry” and “repetitive.” Several students praised the course for being well designed and organized. 

Most students considered Professor Kable “incredibly kind and knowledgeable.” Several students, however, noted that his lectures occasionally bordered on “boring.” Nevertheless, many students appreciated Professor Kable’s attempts to “explain topics in a variety of different ways” and that Professor Kable was consistently “accessible and approachable for any questions.”

This class may fulfill part of the Individual and Group Bases of Behavior requirement for Psychology majors. Many students in this course found the exams and papers “challenging.” Several students indicated that this course includes many assignments for an introductory lecture course, but thought that these assignments helped their grades. The only prerequisite is PSYC 001.

"Psychology 162 explores the concepts of normality, abnormality, and psychopathology. There are three main areas in which different psychological disorders are studied: symptom syndromes, theory, and research in psychopathology and psychotherapy. The different psychological theory approaches are used to look at disorders in a comprehensive way and various treatment suggestions for each type of disorder is given. 

Students agreed that this course was well organized and stimulating. Many thought the class was informative and superior to many other classes because the concepts learned could actually be used in a clinical psychology context, both in diagnosis and treatment. The material is sometimes difficult to master because of the sheer amount of information, but students on the whole reported that the class was highly engaging and it was not difficult to study the material. The only consistent complaint about this course was that the exams were quite difficult. Another student mentioned that they would have liked more time dedicated to discussion as well. 

Professor Ruscio was unanimously liked. She was praised for being extremely interesting to listen to and students loved her use of different media clips to demonstrate what she was discussing. In addition, she was referred to as kind, brilliant, and intelligent, and “able to articulate complex and lengthy material.” Professor Ruscio cares a lot about her students and was very available outside of class. Many students commented that her office hours were very worthwhile. 

The workload for this class is a bit heavy, as there is intense studying from the textbook and notes required to do well on exams. Many students found it generous and helpful that Professor Ruscio provided extremely detailed study guides for each exam. The exams can be a bit tricky so studying hard is essential. However, there was agreement that the class was well worth the work because many students claim it to be “one of the best classes” at Penn. The class is recommended for anyone with an interest in abnormal psychology, majors or non-majors alike. The only prerequisite is PSYC 001.

Students were in agreement that the course was interesting and the material stimulating. The course relied heavily on the textbook and did not really expand further from what was presented in readings, though this did help focus studying. The lectures and the readings were organized in a clear manner according to the syllabus so students “found it easy to organize study materials.” The course was overall thought to be “well taught” and enjoyable.

Professor Boyd received mixed reviews. Overall, she was thought to know the material very well and was able to communicate it clearly. However, she was also said to be not as engaging as students would have liked. The lecture slides are taken straight out of the text, so there is not much expansion off of the book. Professor Boyd also stuck to a strict grading scale that arguably did not take into account “progress or effort.” 

Abnormal psychology comes recommended to anyone with an interest. There is a large amount of studying of the text required for exams and a couple short writing assignments. The class moves quite fast, but contains such interesting subject matter that students enjoyed taking it. The only prerequisite is PSYC 001.

The reception of this class was mixed. Many students felt that the material was monotonous and repetitive. Others appreciated that Penn offered a zoology class like this one. While one student described it as the “best bio class thus far,” about half of the students were underwhelmed.

Some students praised Profesor Cheney’s lecturing ability, but many expressed dissatisfaction with her PowerPoint presentations, labeling them as “wordy.” Some students were dissatisfied that she was overly concerned with research, sometimes at the expense of teaching. 

This is a required course for multiple majors, including Biological Basis of Behavior. It is populated by upperclassmen.  A few students complained about the exam grading system, saying that it was too easy to get a few things wrong and end up with a C. However, there were few complaints about the workload.

"Psychology 231 is a study of the evolution of social behavior in animals, with special emphasis on group formation, cooperation among kin, mating systems, territoriality and communication.

The reception of this class was mixed. Many students felt that the material was monotonous and repetitive. Others appreciated that Penn offered a zoology class like this one. While one student described it as the “best bio class thus far,” about half of the students were underwhelmed.

The reviews for Professor Seyfarth were mixed. Some students felt that Seyfarth was engaging while others thought him a little monotonous. According to most, he successfully generated interest among students.  Most agree that he was knowledgeable, but some commented on his lack of interest toward students.

"Psychology 253 is a course that focuses on processes of thinking, judgment, and personal and societal decision-making. Within each of these fields, there is a large emphasis on fallacies and biases humans use. Different approaches to decisions are looked at, including the utilitarian approach, and students learn how to analyze decisions using various methods. 

Students seemed to have very mixed feeling about this course. The layout of the course provoked some complaints of disorganization due to the co-teaching, and students found that the material did not mesh well together. In addition, there was heavy reliance on the textbook. The concepts were agreed to be interesting, applicable in real life, and quite simple, but the course did not reach many students’ expectations in terms of quality. One student said it was a “good overview of many psychology concepts,” but another added that the class “is not conducive to help students learn the material.” 

Many students attributed the lack of coherence to the teaching style of Professor Baron. Although Professor Baron is a well-known figure in the field of decision research, he often rambles in lectures and makes it difficult to pay attention. He often left students “deeply confused” due to his tangential speech. Professor Baron also had difficulty stimulating student interest. 

Economics majors and minors, as well as psychology majors, were the large majority of students that took this course. There were a few students taking it as an elective, but ultimately it came recommended only to majors or minors. The workload was not terribly large, but the grading often seemed arbitrary and students wondered where they stood. Students seemed to agree that, overall, they did not find the course an overly positive experience and many echoed the opinion that the teaching could definitely be improved.

Professor Mellers was said to have “saved the course.” Her lectures were seen as much more linear and engaging than Professor Baron’s. Students were glad that she added more information to what students read in the text. She was praised as doing a “wonderful job.”

"Psychology 462 is a seminar style class that focuses on varying topics in abnormal psychology. Each class consists of reading and discussion. Students are also expected to complete a presentation, a final paper, and a final exam. 

Students reported general approval and praise of this course. They found the subject matter to be interesting and applicable to “many things outside of lecture.” The course used many forms of teaching aides such as films, lectures, and PowerPoints to enhance discussions. Each of these added something new to the course and each was described as being “fun,” “educational,” and “good examples” of what was being learned. A majority of students described this course as “interesting.” 

Professor Krause was applauded for her ability to communicate subject matter and was referred to as a “great professor.” Students expressed their desire to have less student presentations, as discussions could branch out and become less engaging. However, Professor Krause tried to keep student interest alive and was “clearly passionate” about what she was teaching. Professor Krause was also said to be very “personable” and to have constantly had a positive attitude in class. 

The workload of this course raised some concerns to students because it is not spread out through the semester. Though the amount of work assigned is relatively normal for a higher-level class, most of the assignments were due later on in the course, with one deadline right after another. The class is recommended to anyone with an interest in looking at abnormal psychology further, but the majority of students in the class are psychology majors. The only prerequisite is PSYC 162.

"*Psychology 462 studies sleep problems, such as insomnia and chronic nightmares, which are commonly reported by people with psychological disorders. This seminar will review existing treatments for such disorders (including depression, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and several others) with a special emphasis on ways to integrate sleep treatments into more traditional approaches. Basic findings from sleep science and psychopathology will be discussed in order to better understand the principles that drive existing treatments and to propose new treatments that might work even better.

Students very much enjoyed this “engaging and thought-provoking” class that covered “fascinating” material. While students commented that the readings were hard, they believed they felt like they were actually learning and digesting the material, as opposed to just trying to pass a test and get a good grade. Students wished this class had been a little smaller to facilitate more open discussion, but overall they were greatly pleased by the course.

The students in this course unanimously praised Professor Minkel. They stated that “he was the reason this class was excellent” and that he was the most “approachable and genuinely interested professor at Penn.” Furthermore, he was described as “effective, exceptional, and very passionate.”

Students would recommend this course to any student interested in psychology.

"This course is an introduction to the structure and function of the vertebrate
nervous system. The class begins with the cellular basis of neuronal activities, then
discusses the physiological bases of motor control, sensory systems, motivated behaviors,
and higher mental processes. This course is intended for students interested in the
neurobiology of behavior, ranging from animal behaviors to clinical disorders.
The material for this course was considered “fascinating.” Many students called
this course “amazing,” the “highlight” of their semesters, and their “favorite class of all
time.”
Professor Medina was “fantastic,” “very accessible” and “one of the best
professors” they’ve had. One student commented that he would “wholeheartedly
recommend” Professor Medina. He was “knowledgeable” and “entertaining,” while also
being “very clear.” His lecture recordings from the class were also “extremely helpful.”
Students commented that this class was “very difficult.” One student called the
exam the “weakest part” of the class. Besides being difficult, exams were very long and
required application of a lot of memorized information. However, students noted that the
exams were “fair.”",24047-401-4262-JAVIER-F--MEDINA,JAVIER F.,4262-JAVIER-F--MEDINA,MEDINA,JAVIER F.

"How do minds work? This course surveys a wide range of answers to this
question from the disciplines ranging from philosophy to neuroscience. The course
devotes special attention to the use of simple computational and mathematical models.
Topics include perception, action, thought, learning, memory and social interaction.
Students were generally pleased with this course. Most students described the
course as “interesting.” One student described it as “A thought provoking course” on “a
very contemporary and important modern subject.” The broad and interdisciplinary
nature of the course was appreciated by some, but many others described it as
“scattered,” “unorganized,” and “disjointed.”
A student described Professor Ungar as “highly knowledgeable”. Students felt
that Professor Ungar did a good job of replying to questions on the course Blackboard
discussion board. Lecture slides and class recordings were made available to the students.
Most students mentioned that this course required a lot of homework. There were
many readings, but one student described it as “very interesting reading material” and
wrote that the “course overall helps develop critical thinking and logic.” Some
complained that the lectures on the mathematical aspects were rushed. Many students
commented on the large class size and some would have liked the class to have a
recitation. Many students found this course useful in deciding their own majors and
recommended it to anyone. This class fulfills the formal reasoning sector for college
students.",24164-401-2085-LYLE-H-UNGAR,LYLE H,2085-LYLE-H-UNGAR,UNGAR,LYLE H UNGAR,/instructor/2085-LYLE-H-UNGAR,164,176,/courses/24164/sections/401/reviews/2085-LYLE-H-UNGAR,2.71,3.00,2.71,2.19,3.10,3.09,2.21,3.42,2.57,3.15,,2.48,"['CIS-140-401', 'COGS-001-401', 'PPE-140-401', 'PHIL-044-401', 'PSYC-207-401', 'LING-105-401']",24164-401,INTRO COGNITIVE SCIENCE,/courses/24164/sections/401,CIS-140-401,401,2011C
"This course surveys a wide range of answers to the question “how do minds work?” Students look at
disciplines ranging from philosophy to neuroscience. The course devotes special attention
to the use of simple computational and mathematical models. Topics include perception,
learning, memory, decision making, emotion and consciousness.
Students reported that this course was “scattered” and “random,” but still
“interesting.” Students did note that the nature of the field is broad, and that the
introductory course just sweeps the surface of the field’s foci. Students felt that the
content was “too broad,” so they were unable to “learn anything valuable.” Depending
on the student’s interest in the field of cognitive science, some students deemed this
course the “best course” at Penn or the “worst course” at Penn.
Overall, students were pleased with Professor Brainard. He offered many office
hours and was “extremely accessible.” In addition, students found office hours very
helpful. Students noted that they enjoyed Professor Brainard’s lectures. Although
students found the course scattered, they recognized that Professor Brainard attempted to
make connections.
Student’s found the course relatively difficult, but they noted that recitations,
office hours, and lectures were very helpful. Students found that the course emphasized
statistics and scientific analysis more than they had anticipated, which made the work
more complex and difficult. Overall, there was a “fair amount” of work associated with
the course. This counts as a Formal Reasoning course for College students.

"Statistics 500 focuses on two unrelated topics: loglinear and logit models for discrete data and nonparametric methods for nonnormal data, with emphasis on practical methods of data analysis and their interpretation. 

Most students found this class to be “helpful” and claimed that it “covered a lot of useful material.”  Students suggested that this class would be particularly “helpful to the researchers who have some experiences with statistics knowledge.”

Professor Rosenbaum received many compliments from students and was called “engaging and entertaining.” Students were especially impressed with Professor Rosenbaum’s ability to “communicate complex material in such a way that the emphasis is on applied statistics, but enough background is given to aid comprehension.”

This class is an applied graduate level course for students who have completed an undergraduate course in basic statistical methods. This course is primarily for doctoral students in the managerial, behavioral, social, and health sciences. Before taking the class, the permission of instructor is recommended. Students found the workload in this class to be “appropriate.”

A key factor in the students’ reactions to the class seemed to be their comfort with the mathematical concepts involved, since it “engages almost exclusively with statistical models of human memory.”
Student opinions of Professor Kahana were similarly mixed. Some used words such as “hilarious,” “bright,” and “well-spoken” to describe the professor and others further portrayed him as “extremely knowledgeable and very enthusiastic about the course.” One student said he “was very open to speaking with students and had the goal of getting to know every student personally.” A few described his style as “boring” and were unappreciative of him “jumping from one tangent to another.”
Though the material seemed to have a heavy mathematical focus, some students recommend the course to “anyone who is interested in psychology or just looking for an interesting elective.” Others felt the course would be irrelevant to most students unless they were “planning to study human memory or go into this field.”

"The course covers the concepts of normality, abnormality, and psychopathology; symptom syndromes; theory and research in psychopathology and psychotherapy.
The course generally focused on the clinical aspect of the subject, which some students felt made it less interesting. On the other hand, some felt the casebook readings were essential for understanding real world applications of the subject matter.
Most students found Professor Krause to be a good lecturer and found that she had “enthusiasm for the subject matter,” which “made lectures consistently engaging and significantly aided in understanding of the course content.” Professor Krause brought in many guest lecturers and this approach received mixed reviews from his students.
Students noted that there was a lot of textbook reading and pointed out that the exams covered material from the reading that was not covered in lecture. The course was recommended to anyone with an interest in psychology, and especially for majors.

"Positive psychology is the scientific study of happiness, meaning, engagement, accomplishment, and virtue. This course focuses on valid assessments of these constructs, their causes and correlates, and interventions that have been shown to promote them. In addition to reading selected textbook chapters and primary research articles, students will complete positive psychology exercises and reflect upon their experience in written assignments.
Overall, students were very appreciative of the content of the course. Several felt that this was the best class they had taken at Penn. Students frequently used words such as “enlightening,” “interesting,” and “engaging,” with one student claiming that it was “a pleasure and great experience to come to class.” Another said that “the lecture material was so interesting most of the time that I personally did not have to make any effort to concentrate; engagement came naturally.”
Professor Duckworth received near unanimous praise from her students. She was described as “kind,” “knowledgeable,” and “stimulating,” a “phenomenal instructor with a real gift for teaching.” One student said that Professor Duckworth was “very good at explaining the material [and] connecting the information to other areas of the course,” while another claimed that “she has a gift of making a large lecture feel like a small seminar.” Some students, however, felt that Professor Duckworth could sometimes come across as “condescending” by continually explaining her expectations of the class.
Many were quick to suggest this class to their peers. One student said, “I am obsessed with this course and recommend it to every single student at Penn,” while another called it “a fantastic class, and one which everybody should take (regardless of major).” Several did caution, however, against assuming that the course will be easy. In the words of one student, “you have to work for your grade and the exams are not as easy as you think they will be.”",26692-001-3612-ANGELA-L-DUCKWORTH,ANGELA L,3612-ANGELA-L-DUCKWORTH,DUCKWORTH,ANGELA L DUCKWORTH,/instructor/3612-ANGELA-L-DUCKWORTH,105,117,/courses/26692/sections/1/reviews/3612-ANGELA-L-DUCKWORTH,2.95,3.44,3.19,2.24,3.47,3.50,2.52,3.58,3.15,3.43,,2.07,['PSYC-166-001'],26692-001,INTRO.POSITIVE PSYCH.,/courses/26692/sections/1,PSYC-166-001,001,2010A
"This course is an introduction to the study of positive emotions, positive character traits, and positive institutions. The positive emotions consist of emotions about the past (serenity, satisfaction, pride), about the future (hope, optimism, faith), and emotions about the present (pleasure and gratification). In this course, distinction between the pleasant life, the good life, and the meaningful life is drawn.

Most students said that they greatly enjoyed this course, with one saying, “[This class was] one of the only [ones] I was excited to go to.” Many praised it for the knowledge they felt they gained; the course was described as laying a solid foundation for students’ understanding of the new field of positive psychology. Students used words such as “excellent” and “amazing” to describe the course, while one claimed the following: “It could change your life!”

Students also had plenty of praise for Professor Parks-Sheiner, calling her “a great teacher who conveys knowledge with passion and zest while making the classroom a welcome place for all students.” She reputedly is a skilled lecturer and often led “interesting class discussions.”

The class has weekly response papers and requires posting on an online discussion board. The grading was described as “very fair” and the work as “well-balanced.” Students praised the course format and were pleased that the course had no midterms and no final exam, just a final paper. The class is open to all class levels but has PSYC-001 as a prerequisite. *This review is based on the 7 student comments that were submitted.

Overall, students were pleased with the content and the structure of the class. Many thought that lectures were “clear, concise, and easy to follow,” describing the material as “relevant” and “engaging.” Some students felt that the course’s primary focus on psychological experiments made it a bit “redundant,” with several claiming that there were “too many overlaps with the introductory psychology course.”
Reviews of Professor Goodwin were overwhelmingly positive. According to one student, “Dr. Goodwin really engages students with fun examples relevant to our everyday lives. Class is always interesting.” Another described him as “very articulate and engaging,” praising his ability to “communicate the subject matter well.” Many students felt that his lectures were “very straightforward and very organized,” allowing him to maximize class time. Several also commended his use of clickers to increase student participation, viewing it as “a great way to see how you are understanding the material.”
Many students felt that grading on various assessments throughout the class was “harsh” and “arbitrary.” Some claimed that the difficulty of the exams was an unpleasant surprise yet it was not too difficult to do well if you were well prepared.

It will cover areas ranging from reasoning to relationships to culture.

Students overwhelmingly liked the course, describing it as “wonderful,” “strongly recommended,” and “one of the best at Penn.” The material was reportedly very interesting, but often difficult to grasp and theoretical in nature. Students praised how the material was unlike any other PSYC class and taught new ways of thinking.

"This advanced seminar will focus on how theory and research in positive psychology help individuals live more satisfying, meaningful, and fulfilled lives. Students will be encouraged to explore how the current research may be applicable to their own lives. Topics will include positive interventions, happiness-increasing exercises, and other efforts of self-improvement in both clinical and non-distressed populations. Other more general topics of relevance to the study of happiness and well-being will be examined (e.g., theories of well-being, measurement of well-being, assessment of intervention research).

"BIBB109 introduces students to the structure and function of the vertebrate nervous system. Starting from the cellular level, students move up to study higher levels of the nervous system. The course is intended for those interested in the neurobiology of behavior in humans and other vertebrate animals. Familiarity with introductory physics and chemistry may be helpful. This class fulfills College Sector V: Living World.

Most students enjoyed the class, which “really interesting.” For some students, this course was the “most inspiring course” they had ever taken. One student called the course an “excellent overview of current topics in neuroscience.” However, a few students said that there was a lot of information to memorize, and that the lectures were often hard to follow.

Students described Professor Muzzio as “very intelligent” and “passionate.” Many students appreciated that she was very accessible and took the time to meet with students and answer their questions. Professor Muzzio “was able to stimulate interest” in a wide range of topics. A few students noted that, whether because of the lecture hall’s acoustics, Professor Muzzio could be hard to understand at times.

Premedical students usually take this course with some College students who are fulfilling the Living World sector requirement. One student noted that the class was competitive, and a few students commented that the exam did not reflect the material learned.

"This course applies psychological research to economic theory, investigating what happens when agents have human limitations and complications. The effects of limited cognitive capacities, willpower, and self-interest will be considered.

Most students agreed that the course was challenging but found the information “fascinating” and very applicable to real life situations.

Students varied in their opinions of Professor Dana. Some lauded him for his humor, but others found his sarcasm “controversial” and “patronizing.” Some complained that Professor Dana read from his slides too often while others appreciated that the theories were straight-forward. Students were also split on his teaching style, either describing Professor Dana as “funny” and “engaging” or as ""uninteresting.""

This course is a required course for PPE majors, and ECON 001 is a prerequisite. Students mostly agreed that the course was “challenging” and that there was some “disconnect between the class lectures and the exams” since the class focused on theory while the exams focused on numerical calculations.  The course work consisted of “three problem sets and three midterms” with minimal additional readings.

The majority of the students stated that Dr. Epstein was “very knowledgeable and passionate” but sometimes “confusing.” Most students felt that he had a good relationship with the class. A lot of students felt that Dr. Epstein was “too passive,” however, and let the TAs have too much control in grading, allowing for the arbitrary grading.

The positive emotions consist of emotions about the past (e.g., serenity, satisfaction, pride), about the future (e.g., hope, optimism, faith), and emotions about the present (pleasure and gratification). The distinction among the pleasant life, the good life, and the meaningful life is drawn.  The positive traits include wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and spirituality, and the classification of these virtues is explored.  The positive institutions are exemplified by extended families, free press, humane leadership, and representative government.

Overall, students felt like they enjoyed the material and subject matter of the class and felt they could “use it in a real life setting” though they had issues with the structure of the class in general. A vast majority of students stated that the tests were “entirely too focused on minute details” rather than the general themes of the class. While many students remarked that the class was “fun and enjoyable,” they stated that the exams contributed more to their dislike of the class than the material.

Most students agreed that Dr. Duckworth was “engaging, exciting, and always well-prepared,” stating that she “was very accessible and would do anything to have her students success.” A significant portion of the students however, agreed that she could at times be “condescending” and “elitist.” Overall, most students seemed to enjoy Dr. Duckworth’s lectures, but noted that the structure of the class in general needed changing to make it more enjoyable for the professor and student.

Students stated that the pacing of the class needed to be changed, with some lectures covering a great deal of material and some going entirely too slow.

It will also explore the possibility that psychological science itself is not immune to the political debates swirling around it. Specific topics will include: the workings of belief systems (and their power to shape what we ""see""), cognitive biases (and their power to cause miscalculations), sacred values and their role in stabilizing belief systems and social interaction, personality and ideology (the linkages between the personal and the political), and clashing conceptions of morality and distributive and corrective justice (striking variations among people in what they consider to be fair). 

This course was described as “excellent” and “fantastic.” Students expressed the informative nature of the course, and that it was “complex.” One student “enjoyed the simulative nature of the discussion in class.” Sometimes the homework could be “ambiguous and confusing.” There are also “pop” debates in the class.

Dr. Tetlock is described as “very knowledgeable and intelligent individual” and students “really enjoyed the themes and overarching lessons that Professor Tetlock tried to instill within his students.” He is also “extremely dedicated and conscientious” and described as “approachable.

With regards to the course load, there were comments regarding “useless assignments,” such as the pop debates and class surveys. There is also a class participation component to the course. Much of the course work will be done outside of class. The prerequisite to this course is PSYC 001.",28076-001-5521-PHILIP-E--TETLOCK,PHILIP E.,5521-PHILIP-E--TETLOCK,TETLOCK,PHILIP E.

"This course offers a developmental perspective on the general empirical and theoretical psychology of perception, cognition, language, learning, comparative ethology, and socialization. Students are required to have taken PYSC001 before they can enroll in this course.
Students seemed to be somewhat split on the course. Some appreciated the “general foundation of material” provided, while others were less enthusiastic about the “painful” guest lecturers and the amount of reading. Some complained about how students were unable to have their own copies of lecture slides, which were “copyrighted so that students could not have printed copies to refer to.” Certain students complained about the article review assignments, which they felt were “awful” and unhelpful. Textbooks were criticized as “scattered” and unorganized.
Students criticized Professor Jackson for often teaching too fast, “raising the stress level” of the class by talking faster than students could take notes. Other students praised her accessibility, referring to her as “one of the most approachable.” The main criticisms of Professor Jackson stemmed from the unavailability of the lecture slides and her speed.
The perquisite for PSYC 280 is PSYC 001. Students described the workload as “perfect,” while also mentioning that Professor Jackson seemed to be an easy grader. Students all seemed to enjoy the actual material of the course. The problems were in the manner and speed at which it was presented.",28077-601-5865-LEELA-JACKSON,LEELA,5865-LEELA-JACKSON,JACKSON,LEELA JACKSON,/instructor/5865-LEELA-JACKSON,22,24,/courses/28077/sections/601/reviews/5865-LEELA-JACKSON,2.48,2.29,2.32,2.00,3.19,2.41,2.48,3.14,2.14,2.19,,2.14,['PSYC-280-601'],28077-601,DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,/courses/28077/sections/601,PSYC-280-601,601,2012A
"What infants and young children come to know about the world, and how they learn it.  Topics will include changes in children's thinking, perceptual development, language acquisition, and current theories of cognitive development.

	Students noted that this was a “perfectly designed course” and that they “learned a lot” from it. However, future students should be aware that the only grades in the class are based on multiple choice exams, and some students commented that it is unfair to students who are not necessarily as good in this testing format. They stated that “the curriculum was well organized and had a logical, flowing progression from unit to unit.”

Students noted that Professor Swingley is “a great lecturer” and “enthusiastic.” He also “communicat[ed] the subject matter in a way that is accessible and enjoyable.” Others noted that his “passion for the course material was contagious” and on top of that, he is “funny” and “down-to-earth.”

This course has been described by students as “not too difficult.” It may be harder for students who do not typically do well on multiple choice exams. The lectures were described as “fast-paced” but “not too fast for me to keep up and take notes.” The prerequisite for this course is PSYC 001.

"Topics vary each semester.

Overall, this course was described as being valuable and interesting despite being a three hour long seminar. Although the topics discussed in the seminar vary each semester, the students stated that the material covered were “interesting and relevant.” One student described it as a “very balanced, interesting, and high-level course.” There were several topics on sleep, but another student mentioned that “more psychology readings may reinforce the main points of the class better.”

All of the students who reviewed the class had positive comments for Dr. Minkel. They mentioned that he was “a great lecturer” and “treated us like adults.” One student even stated that Dr. Minkel “is hands down the best professor that I’ve had since I’ve been at Penn.” He is “very easy to talk to” and “a well spoken person who loves teaching.”
	
One student suggested that “if you're not interested in sleep or psychopathology, you might not find much of interest in this class, as it’s very focused.” Students should be aware that this is a three hour long seminar that meets once every week. Only undergraduates are permitted to enroll in this class. A prerequisite of PSYC 162 is required.

"	The course will begin with a review of basic concepts in pharmacology: routes of drug administration, drug metabolism, the dose response curve, tolerance, and sensitization. Following a brief overview of cellular foundations of neuropharmacology (cell biology, synaptic and receptor function), the course will focus on various classes of drugs used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders including, among others, depression, schizophrenia,and anxiety. Mechanisms mediating the mind-altering, addictive and neurotoxic effects of abused drugs will also be covered.

	Students really enjoyed this “awesome” course, describing the material as very interesting. Students appreciated the balance of drug use and drug action topics discussed in the class.

"STAT501 explores business responsibility from rival theoretical and managerial perspectives. Its focus includes theories of ethics and their application to case studies in business. Topics include moral issues in advertising and sales; hiring and promotion; financial management; corporate pollution; product safety; and decision-making across borders and cultures.

 Many students thought that this course is “highly recommended” and that they “learned a lot.” The one problem many students noticed is that the notes are not provided in a “legible manner,” making it difficult to learn in class. Students overall found this course, however, to be lectures to be pretty “straightforward.” 

Most students found that Professor Rosenbaum “does a great job explaining complex concepts using examples” and  “does a very good job of engaging students and making the material more accessible.” Many students liked that Professor Rosenbaum was “accessible,” “witty,” “engaging,” and “in complete command of the material in the classroom” making him a “brilliant professor.” However, some students thought that he demonstrated “poor board work” and that is “writing on the chalk board is too small and sloppy” while he “does not organize the things he writes on the board throughout class.” 

Overall, most students found that the subject matter of this course was “difficult to grasp” and that there was a “mismatch between lectures/tests and the assigned readings” because the readings are much more difficult and involved. Many students found the bulk pack to be a “tremendous help” and the practice exams to be “helpful in learning how to apply the methods” while the “books are not helpful with further explanations.” Some students also did not like that there was “not a lot of feedback outside of the exams.” This course’s prerequisites are STAT 101 or 112 or equivalent.
