## Presentation of your data story for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project


#### [VIEW DATA STORY](Final_Project_Presentation.ipynb)

My data story is in the form of an advice column to prospective COMM majors. Life as a prospective COMM major can be difficult and confusing, and there are lots of conflicting pieces of information that a freshman or sophomore must keep in mind when making that kind of decision, and deciding how to plan their courseload each semester.

Moreover, advice columns in general are a fun and readable format for journalism. Something that is often missing from this kind of feature, however, is a data-centric approach. I like the model of a data advice column, especially for something as relatable and necessary as Penn courses advice. At the same time, not all of the data, graphs, and visualizations can be inserted into the advice column format. I have tried to strike the proper balance of text and visuals to enhance the reading experience for theoretical consumers.

There are many stories embedded (and sometimes hidden) within Penn Course Review data. Because the data is available to all Penn students, people may often assume that there are no further stories to be told from this data. My project has tried to show that there are lots of stories to be found if one looks at the PCR data through different lenses. Moreover, it is much easier to be able to compare and aggregate data this way rather than manually by searching individual course and professors into the PCR search bar.

In this data_story_presentation folder there are also copies of the HTML files for the interactive visualizations embedded in my advice column (they are numbered plots 3 through 7). 

Thank you!
