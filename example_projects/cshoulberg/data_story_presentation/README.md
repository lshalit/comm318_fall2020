## Presentation of your data story for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project


#### [VIEW DATA STORY](https://carlysh98.wixsite.com/comm318finalproject)

I have created a series of news articles for the "RealDeal" -- the real estate industry's top publication -- using the energy use data provided by the Philadelphia Office of Sustainability. I published these articles on my fake "RealDeal Philadelphia" website that I created using wix. 

The articles that I wrote revolve around my research question: Have Philadelphia's energy efficiency initiatives made any tangible impact yet? I used the 5 energy benchmarking reports that the Philadelphia Office of Sustainability has made available -- reports mandated by a 2012 bill enacted requiring all buildings over 50,000 SF in Philadelphia to disclose their energy and water use. 

At first, I had planned to only create one story -- assessing whether or not Philly's energy initiatives had made any tangible progress yet -- however, as I worked through my data I came across sub-stories and found it better -- and more interesting -- to create a series of stories about Philly's energy initiatives. 

I tried to make my website look as similar as possible to a RealDeal publication and attempted to mimic their tone and verbage. 

I created 5 articles that you can navigate through on the menu bar at the top of the wix.page. 
The articles are: 

1. Timeline: This article gives the reader a history of the energy efficiencies initiatives in the City and provides key metrics from the past five reports. This article puts my research question into perspective and informs the general reader -- the general citizen -- about initiatives that many people are not aware of. 

2. Benchmarking: This article analyzes changes in energy use and energy STAR ratings over the past 5 years of data to answer the question: Have Philadelphia buildings gotten more energy efficient over the past five years of benchmarking? Have the initiatives made any tangible change yet? 

3. Building Finder: I created a tool combining my data analysis with a widget on wix that takes CSV's and creates an interactive table in which users can search through. This will allow Philadelphia residents to lookup buildings to see whether or not their building is efficient or not. This also can serve as a tool for tenants that focus on sustainability to find office space in buildings that promote sustainability. 

4. Naughty & Nice: This story profiles Philadelphia's most and least efficient buildings in a "round-up" type article. The HTML map that I created with plotly would not add to my website so if you can please try to pretend it is interactive. I uploaded a picture of it to the website and then the actual HTML file to the data presentation file on jupyter so that you can actually see my creation. 

5. University City: This story is about how energy inefficient University city is as compared to the rest of the city. For two schools so ingrained in research and sustainability efforts -- it is suprising how far behind University City's large buildings are.
