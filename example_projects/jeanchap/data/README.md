## Data files for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

To carry out my analysis, I used three .csv files that I downloaded from the internet
All of these files pertain to the Boston Marathon, but each one contains the results from a separate year.
I look at the race results from 2015, 2016 and 2017
All the files contained the same columns, but the number of rows varied because the number of participants was not the same each year
The files are the following

    a) COMM318_Final_Project/data/marathon_results_2015.csv
    b) COMM318_Final_Project/data/marathon_results_2016.csv
    c) COMM318_Final_Project/data/marathon_results_2017.csv

In addition, I created a .csv file that grouped the data for all three years so that I could take the average from all the runners over the three years. This file is the following

    a) COMM318_Final_Project/data/all_data.csv
    
Also, I created my own .csv file that contains the percentage of runners by age band and gender who keep with their qualifying time on race day. I created this file after having done some analysis using the four files listed above. The file is the following 
    
    a) COMM318_Final_Project/data/%_runners.csv
