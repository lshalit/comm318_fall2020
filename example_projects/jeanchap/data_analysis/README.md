## Data analysis notebooks for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

* The following are the notebooks I have created to carry out my data analysis.

1)First, I created three folders where I analyzed The Boston Marathon data (the .csv) files that I downloaded. The data files are the following

    a)COMM318_Final_Project/data_analysis/2015_marathon_data.ipynb
        *This folder contains the analysis I did relevant to this year's Boston Marathon. 
    b)COMM318_Final_Project/data_analysis/2016_marathon_data.ipynb
        *This folder contains the analysis I did relevant to this year's Boston Marathon.
    c)COMM318_Final_Project//data_analysis/2015_marathon_data.ipynb
        *This folder contains the analysis I did relevant to this year's Boston Marathon.
    
 In all of the above files, I looked at
    * How many participants are there per age group?
    * What is the age group with the most participants?
    * What is the mean finish time for each age group separated by gender?
    * What is the mean finish time difference between males and females in the same age division?
    * What percentage of participants keep with their qualifying time on race day?
       

2)I then created a .csv that compiled the data from all three years, and I carried out the majority of my analysis using this file. I separated one part of my analysis in two notebooks (the percentage of runners by gender that keeps with their qualifying time on race day). Still, the majority of my analysis is contained in the "female" notebook. The files are the following

    a) "COMM318_Final_Project//data_analysis/all_years_marathon_data_female.ipynb"
    b) "COMM318_Final_Project//data_analysis/all_years_marathon_data_male.ipynb"
