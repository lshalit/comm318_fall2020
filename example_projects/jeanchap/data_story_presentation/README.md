## Presentation of your data story for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

My project centers around The Boston Marathon. I was initially motivated by the 30 minute qualifying time disparity between men and women. This investigation led me to find further important information about this race and its participants.

I chose to present my data output as a video. I find short informational videos to be very engaging, and I thought that the subject of my investigation lent itself properly for a video.

For the video I created, I was inspired by the short videos that The New York Times, VOX, VICE, and other companies have been releasing on YouTube.

I created the video using my data analysis. I also used archival footage of The Boston Marathon that I found.

I created a video script to serve as the backbone for the video
This is the video script

I uploaded the video to Vimeo so that you could access it more easily.

The video has an access code:
