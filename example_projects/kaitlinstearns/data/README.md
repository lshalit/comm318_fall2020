## Data files for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

* This folder should contain the data files you have used in your analysis


* You should update this README file to list and describe the files.


* You can also create additional sub-folders to better organize your data.
    * For example, you could have a folder called `raw` or `orig` to contain the original data files you downloaded and then a folder called `final` or `clean` that contains versions of these data sheets that you have worked with to clean up missing data, to subset or merge etc.

* The folder `raw` contains the data files that I got from online.
