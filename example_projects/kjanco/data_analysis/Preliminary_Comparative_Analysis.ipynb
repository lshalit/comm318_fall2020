    "Just comparing the maps of the two cities with the bike lanes as a filter, it is clear that Philadelphia's bike lane network is far more robust. However, it is also true that Moscow is a *much* larger city than Philadelphia. Moscow is 970 mi², while Philadelphia is 141.7 mi². Moscow has a population of 11.9 million residents, while Philadelphia has about 1.6 million people.\n",

    "According to a news article on the Moscow city website published in 2018 (https://www.mos.ru/en/news/item/39793073/), there is over 773 km/480.3 miles of bike lanes in local streets and parks in the city. As of 2017, in Philadelphia there is about 200 miles of bike lanes (https://www.inquirer.com/philly/business/transportation/what-you-need-to-know-about-bike-lanes-in-philadelphia-20171129.html), which is close to half of what Moscow has, despite Philadelphia being around seven times smaller than Moscow. \n",

    "Moscow has no official, open data for ridership for its bikeshare. However, according to one recent news article, in 2019 over a seven month period, there were over 5 million trips. The average trip was 19.8 minutes, and they say most trips were for transportation purposes. (https://www.mos.ru/en/news/item/65374073/). \n",
    "\n",
    "From July-September 2019, there were 275,197 Indego rides, with most rides being 8 minutess long. Using the estimate provided in the article, there are far more Velobike trips than Indego trips. \n",

    "Velobike has 442 stations according to the open data - though the Moscow government in the article above claimed there were 528 - while Indego has 147. Although Philadelphia has significantly less stations, it has 1/4 (or 1/5, if using the city's estimate) of the amount of Moscow's bikeshare stations, while being around 1/7 Moscow's size. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both cities have a high concentration of bikeshare stations in the center of the city, particularly for Moscow. It would be easy to say this means that Philadelphia bikeshare stations are more spread out, but also, Moscow is *huge.* "
