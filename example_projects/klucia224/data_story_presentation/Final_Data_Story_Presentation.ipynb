    "The teen pregnancy rate in the United States has been on a [steady decline since 2009](https://www.cdc.gov/teenpregnancy/about/index.htm). In 2017, 194,377 babies were born to women ages 15-19 for a birth rate of about 19% per 1,000 women in this age category. Despite this statistic being a record low for American teens, the United States continues to have the highest teen pregnancy rate of developed nations. \n",

Looking specifically at California, the question I'd like to investigate is whether the race and/or income of a county's population affects the observed proportion of adolescent births. In other words, could the racial and socioeconomic status of a women affect the probability of a teen birth?"

It is important to note that I created another column containing the county's proportion of births, which takes into account the number of births in relation to the county's population. Other key variables in this dataset that I observed include the total population of the county as well as the ethnicity of the mother. Five mutually exclusive race categories are utilized: Hispanic, Multi-Race, Black, American Indian (includes Eskimo and Aleut), Asian and Pacific Islander (includes Hawaiian), and White. \n",

I focused on the \"All Returns\" column, as there is no information on the calculations behind the \"Adjusted Gross Income\" column. I drew conclusions about the income of an average woman in a given county based on this information."

    "One explanation could be the lack of sex education. In 2016, however, the [California Healthy Youth Act](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB329) was enacted, requiring that students in grades 7-12 receive education on human growth and development, including comprehensive sex education as well as birth control, abortion, and HIV prevention education. Of course, a  law does not necessarily guarentee change.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The issue may be deeper than education: it could be access to health clinics. Kayla Wilson teaches sex education for the Office of the Fresno County Superintendent of Schools, and works with Latina teen moms. Fresno is in the top 10 counties in terms of proportion of births. In explaining the [disproportionate birth rates](https://www.centerforhealthjournalism.org/fellowships/projects/teen-birth-rates-are-highest-our-poorest-neighborhoods-they-affect-all-us), she states, “[White affluent girls] are going to clinics. They have transportation. They have more of a means to get birth control.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential factor in these rates could be cultural differences. Although we don't want to make broad cultural generalizations as families' approach to sex education varies on a case by case basis, cultural norms could influence the situation."

Understanding a proposed solution from multiple perspectives is key.**"
