## Data analysis notebooks for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

* This folder should contain the a series of Jupyter notebooks you create to do the data analysis.

* Update this README file to document the notebooks and give a short description of what each one does.

To reiterate, the goal for my research project was to analyze the Philadelphia school district, focusing specifically on how the schools within a three mile radius of Penn's campus compare to the schools in the remainder of the district

I was having a lot of difficulty getting my data files to upload in any notebook within the `COMM318_Final_Projext/data_analysis` folder so all of the Jupyter notebooks that contain the manipulation and exploration of all my data files are located in `COMM318_Final_Project`

My notebooks were made in a somewhat chronologial order when I was doing my analysis, so I listed them as such here.

My first notebook `COMM318_Final_Project/All_Data_Analysis` was the first look and exploration of all the data files that I uploaded.  It gave me a sense of the kind of codes I was going to need to use and helped in getting myself more familiar with the data I was using.  I was also able to get a baseline of information to help answer some of my research questions, but also gave me ideas as to the kind of information I wanted to search for moving forward.

My next notebook `COMM318_Final_Project/ED_SMS_Anlysis` was where I dove a little deeper into more specific school data.  Here I was able to look at the specific attendance, retention, and graduation rates of each of the schools.  I also focused in this notebook on seperating out the schools that were within a three mile radius of Penn's campus, and what the data for these schools looks like. This notebook contains the most substantial amount of information of all of the notebooks because it contains all of the editing and formating of data files and information.
    *ED - Enrollment & Demographics
    *SMS - School Metric Scores

My next notebook is `COMM318_Final_Project/RQ_Analysis`.  I used this notebook to seperate out all of the information that I have accumulated, and dug deeper in order to start formulating conclusions.  I uploaded all of the most updated and revised data files in order to pull information from all of them. This was also the notebook where I drafted all of the information I was going to write up in my data presentation ( which is a data journal article).
