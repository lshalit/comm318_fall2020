#### [VIEW DATA STORY](https://mbod.github.io/comm318_fall2020/example_projects/niamhhayes/data_story_presentation/Final_Data_Story.html)


* This folder should contain the files that contain the output of all your data analysis. You can choose how you want to present your data story.

Similarly to the `data_analysis` folder, I had a lot of trouble getting my data files to load in my notebooks within this folder.  But all of the revised data files that contain all of the output of my data analysis are located within this folder.  Additionally the Notebook `COMM318_Final_Project/RQ_Analysis` and `COMM318_Final_Project/ED_SMS_Analysis` contains a lot of the conclusions that I reached through my research, and are included in the presentation of my data story

* Update this README file to describe the presentation.

I decided to present my data story through a data journal article.  The goal of this article would be informative, spreading information to the Phildelphia commmunities about what their school district looks like as a whole.  But, as a student at Penn and an individual who works in some of West Philadelphia's schools and communities, I do have a personal investment in the data that I am presenting.  Which I believe has an impact on the narrative that the article will take.  It will make the presentation a little more personal than just listing out numbers.

My data story presentation article is the file named `Final_Data_Story`
