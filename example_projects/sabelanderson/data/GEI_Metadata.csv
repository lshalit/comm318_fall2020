Work,Participation,"Full-time equivalent employment rate (%, 15+ population)","The full-time equivalent (FTE) employment rate is a unit to measure employed persons in a way that makes them comparable even though they may work a different number of hours per week. The unit is obtained by comparing an employee’s average number of hours worked to the average number of hours worked by a full-time worker. A full-time worker is therefore counted as one FTE, while a part-time worker gets a score in proportion to the hours she or he works. For example, a part-time worker employed for 20 hours a week where full-time work consists of 40 hours, is counted as 0.5 FTE.","Eurostat, EU LFS
