## Presentation of your data story for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

* This folder should contain the files that contain the output of all your data analysis. You can choose how you want to present your data story.


* Update this README file to describe the presentation.




My presentation of my data story is a news analysis article. It is in a notebook called Final_Story_From_Data.ipynb.

There is a folder called photos_for_data_story of the images used in the final presentation.
