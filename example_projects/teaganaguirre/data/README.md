## Data files for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

* This folder should contain the data files you have used in your analysis


* You should update this README file to list and describe the files.


* You can also create additional sub-folders to better organize your data.
    * For example, you could have a folder called `raw` or `orig` to contain the original data files you downloaded and then a folder called `final` or `clean` that contains versions of these data sheets that you have worked with to clean up missing data, to subset or merge etc.

Folder 1: Raw Data 
This was the folder that I downloaded my orginal data into. After consulting with Roopa, we were unable to re-save geojson files as cleaned data. Thus, I cleaned my data each time I started a new notebook. I only used the file "NeighborhoodFoodRetail.geojson.json"

Folder 2: Raw Data/ Other data I considered using
This folder was a place where I stored other data I thought about using but didn't make the final cut. This data was not used in my project.
