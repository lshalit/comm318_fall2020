## Data analysis notebooks for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

* This folder should contain the a series of Jupyter notebooks you create to do the data analysis.

* Update this README file to document the notebooks and give a short description of what each one does.

Notebook 1: Rough Data Analysis Neighborhood Food Retail.ipynb
* This notebook is a preliminary analysis of my data. In it, I examine the shape and columns of the data. I also cleaned my data and coded out the nonresidential rows. 

Notebook 2: Finding Associations.ipynb
* This notebook looks at the relationships between columns in my data frame. It draws some conclusions about the data and gives me a better sense of how the variables are related to one another. 

Notebook 3: Data Analysis Maps.ipynb
* This notebook maps the columns in the data set using geopandas. I had to collapse some of the numerical columns into categorical values to simplify the maps. Additionally, there is some analysis of the prevalence of healthy food stores in areas.
