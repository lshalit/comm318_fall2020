My storymap aims to show the link between communities that have high poverty rates and low access to healthy foods. It uses analysis from my 3 data analysis workbooks, maps I created using geoJSON data, and interactive maps using the ARC GIS platform. I showed what areas in Philadelphia have the highest access to healhty foods and what areas have lower access.
